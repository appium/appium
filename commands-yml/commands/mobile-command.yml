      ### Android (UiAutomator2 only)
      | Command | Description | Argument | Argument Example |
      | ------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------- |
      | mobile:batteryInfo | Reads the battery information from the device under test | <none> | <none> |

      | mobile:scroll | Scroll the given scrollable element until the element identifier by `strategy` and `selector` becomes visible since Appium 1.18.0. An optional `maxSwipes` property can limit the number of scroll actions. It accepts an optional `element` property which should be the element identifier and scrollable. Without this property, Appium will select the first scrollable container on the view which will be selected by default. Please read `mobileScroll` section in [appium-uiautomator2-driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver/blob/master/lib/commands/general.js) for more details. | `{element, strategy, selector, maxSwipes}` | `{strategy: 'accessibility id', selector: 'target content description'}` |

      | mobile:type | Types the given Unicode string into focused field. The combination of `unicodeKeyboard` capability and the [send keys](https://appium.io/docs/en/commands/element/actions/send-keys/) works as _replacing_ the text field content. The send key in W3C action works only for ASCII. This command helps such cases to append unicode text content against the focused field. | `{text}` | `{text: 'happy testing'}` |
