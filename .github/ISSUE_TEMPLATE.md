## The problem

Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing (or the feature you want to see added to Appium). Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions. For that consider visiting [Appium Forum](https://discuss.appium.io)!

Before reporting the issue make sure that:
- The issue is reproducible with the most recent available server and driver versions<sup>*</sup>.
- There are no other duplicated reports of the same issue.
- Your description of the issue could be used to reproduce/understand it without any additional details.

<sup>*</sup>Appium1 is at its end of life and is not maintained actively anymore as well as compatible driver versions for it. It is highly recommended to switch to
[Appium2](https://appiumpro.com/editions/122-installing-appium-20-and-the-driver-and-plugins-cli) to have
access to the most recent server and driver fixes/updates.

## Link to Appium logs

Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your _full_ Appium logs, and link them here.
Do _NOT_ paste your full Appium logs here, as it will make this issue very long and hard to read!
If you are reporting a bug, _always_ include Appium logs!
