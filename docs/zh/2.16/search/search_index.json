As part of this program, we felt it was important to have a place to recognize those companies who make an extremely valuable kind of contribution to the project: dedicated maintainer time. Appium only survives because of the tireless efforts of the core maintainers, and some of us are only able to do this work because it is donated on behalf of our day jobs. We're therefore very excited to announce our first Development Partner: HeadSpin!</p> <p>HeadSpin is a real device performance and UX analysis cloud, with full support for Appium. When you run your Appium tests on HeadSpin, you get access to comprehensive performance reports about your app, including potential network, system resource, or user experience issues. HeadSpin supports a variety of complex testing modes, including hooking up your own devices to the cloud, injecting and receiving video and audio to/from devices, working with media (streaming) platforms, and more.</p> <p>HeadSpin has been one of the Appium project's biggest supporters for a long time, and currently employs two of Appium's core maintainers, donating a significant portion of their time towards the development, maintenance, support, and leadership of open source Appium repos. HeadSpin has also worked hard towards Appium's vision of a robust Appium ecosystem, contributing several HeadSpin-maintained Appium drivers and plugins to the community:</p> <ul> <li>A Roku TV driver</li> <li>A Tizen TV driver</li> <li>A LG webOS TV driver</li> <li>A Unity game automation plugin</li> </ul> <p>These are all free and open source Appium components that HeadSpin has donated to the community with the goal of fostering collaboration in these areas of media app automation.</p> <p>Looking to the future, HeadSpin plans to continue supporting Appium in significant ways, both as a Development Partner and a significant contributor to the Appium ecosystem. The Appium project is deeply indebted to HeadSpin for all of its support, and is proud to take this moment to recognize HeadSpin as our first official Development Partner!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/06/10/announcing-sauce-labs-as-appiums-strategic-partner/","title":"Announcing Sauce Labs as Appium's Strategic Partner","text":"<p>The good news surrounding our new sponsorship and contributor compensation program just keeps coming! Effective immediately we are fortunate and excited to be able to welcome a new Strategic Partner to the Appium project: Sauce Labs!</p> <p>Sauce Labs has a long history of support for the Appium project. In fact, Appium was initially incubated at Sauce Labs under the direction of @jlipps, in the early days of mobile automation. Sauce Labs always envisioned Appium as being a project for and by the community, and cemented this perspective in 2016 with the donation of Appium to the JS Foundation (now the OpenJS Foundation). To this day, developers associated with Sauce Labs continue to help maintain various parts of the Appium project.</p> <p>Now, Sauce Labs is making a further commitment to support Appium financially as a way to enable our new contributor compensation program. We're very excited about this program as a vehicle for getting more people involved in Appium's development and maintenance. With the help of Strategic Partners like Sauce Labs, our project will be better able to meet the needs of our constantly growing userbase, and attract new developers (like you?) to build the Appium ecosystem together. Needless to say, we are extremely grateful for Sauce Labs's support!</p> <p>About Sauce Labs</p> <p>Sauce Labs is the leader in continuous quality. Our Platform for Test helps organizations transform software testing from a chore to a competitive advantage. With decades of expertise and deep roots in the Selenium and Appium open source communities, high performing software teams use our platform to execute any testing workload across thousands of different devices, browsers, and operating systems\u2014anywhere, any time, and at any scale.

This program is now officially launching! Let's dive into some of the details.</p> <p>First of all, the details and fine print will always be available at Appium's Governance document, which outlines how the project is run, who makes project decisions, etc... This document will be kept up to date with the latest details of the program, so that's the place to bookmark for reference!</p> <p>As of now, Appium has opened up sponsorship opportunities via our OpenCollective page. OpenCollective is a service which allows people to donate to open source groups. We've defined a number of giving tiers for donations, within a very wide range, and welcome any financial amount with gratitude! Based on the donation tier, sponsorship comes with a variety of benefits, including recognition at different places in the Appium repo, docs, and website. In addition to financial sponsorship, the project has decided to recognize significant donations of project leadership and maintenance efforts from companies who have invested heavily into Appium with their employees' time (we call these \"Development Partners\").</p> <p>What will the project do with the funds raised through this sponsorship program? We aim to give it all back to the Appium community! With the details again available at our Governance document, we have implemented a scheme very much inspired by our friends at WebdriverIO (thanks WDIO friends!) There are three groups of contributors to Appium that this scheme supports: (1) project maintainers (those who devote consistent time to leading the project), (2) project contributors (anyone in the wider community that contributes code or documentation), and (3) upstream projects (other open source projects Appium relies heavily on to work well). Each month, the funds raised via sponsorship will be distributed in different amounts to each of these groups. So if you make a valuable contribution to Appium moving forward, you'll be eligible to get some cash as a thank-you! (You'll need to have your own OpenCollective account in good standing to receive funds).</p> <p>We're very excited about this new program, and hope that it helps existing and new contributors to feel even better about donating their time to making Appium better. And of course, none of this would be possible without the amazing Partners and Sponsors we hope to attract! On that note, stay tuned over the next few weeks as we unveil some of our initial program launch Partners! And if you or your company would like to participate by supporting Appium financially, you are most welcome. Just head over to our OpenCollective page and choose the tier that reflects your desired contribution level.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/03/07/hello-world/","title":"Hello World!","text":"<p>This is the first post in the Appium blog.

of Individual Arguments via <code>ajv</code>","text":"<p>When we think of a JSON schema, we tend to think, \"I have this JSON file and I want to validate it against the schema\". That's valid, and in fact Appium does just that with config files! However, Appium does not do this when validating arguments.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u610f</p> <p>During implementation, I was tempted to mash all of the arguments together into a config-file-like data structure and then validate it all at once. I think that would have been possible, but since an object full of CLI arguments is a flat key/value structure and the schema is not, this seemed like trouble.</p> <p>Instead, Appium validates a value against a specific property within the schema. To do this, it maintains a mapping between a CLI argument definition and its corresponding property. The mapping itself is a <code>Map</code> with a unique identifier for the argument as the key, and an <code>ArgSpec</code> (<code>lib/schema/arg-spec.js</code>) object as the value.</p> <p>An <code>ArgSpec</code> object stores the following metadata:</p> Property Name Description <code>name</code> Canonical name of the argument, corresponding to the property name in the schema. <code>extType?</code> <code>driver</code> or <code>plugin</code>, if appropriate <code>extName?</code> Extension name, if appropriate <code>ref</code> Computed <code>$id</code> of the property in the schema <code>arg</code> Argument as accepted on CLI, without leading dashes <code>dest</code> Property name in parsed arguments object (as returned by <code>argparse</code>'s <code>parse_args()</code>) <code>defaultValue?</code> Value of the <code>default</code> keyword in schema, if appropriate <p>When a schema is finalized, the <code>Map</code> is populated with <code>ArgSpec</code> objects for all known arguments.</p> <p>So when the adapter is creating the pipeline of functions for the argument's <code>type</code>, it already has an <code>ArgSpec</code> for the argument. It creates a function which calls <code>validate(value, ref)</code> (in <code>lib/schema/schema.js</code>) where <code>value</code> is whatever the user provided, and <code>ref</code> is the <code>ref</code> property of the <code>ArgSpec</code>. The concept is that <code>ajv</code> can validate using any <code>ref</code> it knows about; each property in a schema can be referenced by this <code>ref</code> whether it's defined or not. To help visualize, if a schema is:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"$id\": \"my-schema.json\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>ref</code> of <code>foo</code> would be <code>my-schema.json#/properties/foo</code>. Assuming our <code>Ajv</code> instance knows about this <code>my-schema.json</code>, then we can call its <code>getSchema(ref)</code> method (which has a <code>schema</code> property, but is a misnomer nonetheless) to get a validation function; <code>validate(value, ref)</code> in <code>schema.js</code> calls this validation function.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u610f</p> <p>The schema spec says a schema author can supply an explicit <code>$id</code> keyword to override this; it's unsupported by Appium at this time. If needed, extension authors must carefully use <code>$ref</code> without custom <code>$id</code>s. It's highly unlikely an extension would have a schema so complicated as to need this, however; Appium itself doesn't even use <code>$ref</code> to define its own properties!</p> <p>Next, let's take a look at how Appium loads schemas. This actually happens before any argument validation.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/config-system/#schema-loading","title":"Schema Loading","text":"<p>Let's ignore extensions for a moment, and start with the base schema.</p> <p>When something first imports the <code>lib/schema/schema.js</code> module, an instance of an <code>AppiumSchema</code> is created. This is a singleton, and its methods are exported from the module (all of which are bound to the instance).</p> <p>The constructor does very little; it instantiates an <code>Ajv</code> instance and configures it with Appium's custom keywords and adds support for the <code>format</code> keyword via the ajv-formats module.</p> <p>Otherwise, the <code>AppiumSchema</code> instance does not interact with the <code>Ajv</code> instance until its <code>finalize()</code> method (exported as <code>finalizeSchema()</code>) is called. When this method is called, we're saying \"we are not going to add any more schemas; go ahead and create <code>ArgSpec</code> objects and register schemas with <code>ajv</code>\".</p> <p>When does finalization happen? Well:</p> <ol> <li>When the <code>appium</code> executable begins, it checks for and configures extensions (hand-wave) in <code>APPIUM_HOME</code>.</li> <li>Only then does it start to think about arguments--it instantiates an <code>ArgParser</code>, which (as you'll recall) runs the adapter to convert the schema to arguments.</li> <li>Finalization happens here--when creating the parser. Appium need the schema(s) to be registered with <code>ajv</code> in order to create validation functions for arguments.</li> <li>Thereafter, Appium parses the arguments with the <code>ArgParser</code>.</li> <li>Finally, decides what to do with the returned object.</li> </ol> <p>Without extensions, <code>finalize()</code> still knows about the Appium base schema (<code>appium-config-schema.js</code>), and just registers that. However, step 1. above is doing a lot of work, so let's look at how extensions come into play.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/config-system/#extension-support","title":"Extension Support","text":"<p>One of the design goals of this system is the following:</p> <p>An extension should be able to register custom CLI arguments with the Appium, and a user should be able to use them like any other argument.</p> <p>Previously, Appium 2 accepted arguments in this manner (via <code>--driverArgs</code>), but validation was hand-rolled and required extension implementors to use a custom API. It also required the user to awkwardly pass a JSON string as the configuration on the command-line. Further, no contextual help (via <code>--help</code>) existed for these arguments.</p> <p>Now, by providing a schema for its options, a driver or plugin can register CLI arguments and config file schemas with Appium.</p> <p>To register a schema, an extension must provide the <code>appium.schema</code> property in its <code>package.json</code>. The value may be a schema or a path to a schema. If the latter, the schema should be JSON or a CommonJS module (ESM not supported at this time, nor is YAML).</p> <p>For any property in this schema, the property will appear as a CLI argument of the form <code>--&lt;extension-type&gt;-&lt;extension-name&gt;-&lt;property-name&gt;</code>. For example, if the <code>fake</code> driver provides a property <code>foo</code>, the argument will be <code>--driver-fake-foo</code>, and will show in <code>appium server --help</code> like any other CLI argument.</p> <p>The corresponding property in a config file would be <code>server.&lt;extension-type&gt;.&lt;extension-name&gt;.&lt;property-name&gt;</code>, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"server\": {\n    \"driver\": {\n      \"fake\": {\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The naming convention described above avoids problems of one extension type having a name conflict with a different extension type.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u610f</p> <p>While an extension can provide aliases via <code>appiumCliAliases</code>, \"short\" flags are disallowed, since all arguments from extensions are prefixed with <code>--&lt;extension-type&gt;-&lt;extension-name&gt;-</code>. The extension name and argument name will be kebab-cased for the CLI, according to Lodash's rules around kebab-casing.</p> <p>The schema object will look much like Appium's base schema, but it will only have top-level properties (nested properties are currently unsupported). Example:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"title\": \"my rad schema for the cowabunga driver\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"fizz\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"buzz\",\n      \"$comment\": \"corresponds to CLI --driver-cowabunga-fizz\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As written in a user's config file, this would be the <code>server.driver.cowabunga.fizz</code> property.</p> <p>When extensions are loaded, the <code>schema</code> property is verified and the schema is registered with the <code>AppiumSchema</code> (it is not registered with <code>Ajv</code> until <code>finalize()</code> is called).</p> <p>During finalization, each registered schema is added to the <code>Ajv</code> instance. The schema is assigned an <code>$id</code> based on the extension type and name (which overrides whatever the extension provides, if anything). Schemas are also forced to disallowed unknown arguments via the <code>additionalProperties: false</code> keyword.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the base schema has <code>driver</code> and <code>plugin</code> properties which are objects. When finalized, a property is added to each--corresponding to an extension name--and the value of this property is a reference to the <code>$id</code> of a property in the extension schema. For example, the <code>server.driver</code> property will look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"driver\": {\n    \"cowabunga\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"driver-cowabunga.json\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is why we call it the \"base\" schema--it is mutated when extensions provide schemas. The extension schemas are kept separately, but the references are added to the schema before it's ultimately added to <code>ajv</code>. This works because an <code>Ajv</code> instance understands references from any schema it knows about to any schema it knows about.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u610f</p> <p>This makes it impossible to provide a complete static schema for Appium and the installed extensions (as of Nov 5 2021). A static <code>.json</code> schema is generated from the base (via a Gulp task), but it does not contain any extension schemas. The static schema also has uses beyond Appium; e.g., IDEs can provide contextual error-checking of config files this way. Let's solve this?</p> <p>Just like how we look up the reference ID of a particular argument in the base schema, validation of arguments from extensions happens the exact same way. If the <code>cowabunga</code> driver has the schema ID <code>driver-cowabunga.json</code>, then the <code>fizz</code> property can be referenced from any schema registered with <code>ajv</code> via <code>driver-cowabunga.json#/properties/fizz</code>. \"Base\" schema arguments begin with <code>appium.json#properties/</code> instead.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/config-system/#development-environment-support","title":"Development Environment Support","text":"<p>During the flow of development, a couple extra tasks have been automated to maintain the base schema:</p> <ul> <li>As a post-transpilation step, a <code>lib/appium-config.schema.json</code> gets generated from</li> <li><code>lib/schema/appium-config-schema.js</code> (in addition to its CJS counterpart generated by Babel).</li> <li>This file is under version control.

Appium drivers have the ability to turn on a special 'proxy' mode, wherein the Appium server process takes a look at incoming URLs, and decides whether to forward them on to some upstream WebDriver server. It could happen that a command which a plugin wants to handle is designated as a command which is being proxied to an upstream server. In this case, we run into a problem, because the plugin never gets a chance to handle that command! For this reason, plugins can implement a special member function called <code>shouldAvoidProxy</code>, which takes the following parameters:</p> <ol> <li><code>method</code> - string denoting HTTP method (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, etc...)</li> <li><code>route</code> - string denoting the requested resource, for example <code>/session/8b3d9aa8-a0ca-47b9-9ab7-446e818ec4fc/source</code></li> <li><code>body</code> - optional value of any type representing the WebDriver request body</li> </ol> <p>These parameters define an incoming request. If you want to handle a command in your plugin which would normally be proxied directly through a driver, you could disable or 'avoid' proxying the request, and instead have the request fall into the typical Appium command execution flow (and thereby your own command function). To avoid proxying a request, just return <code>true</code> from <code>shouldAvoidProxy</code>. Some examples of how this method is used are in the Universal XML plugin (where we want to avoid proxying the <code>getPageSource</code> command, or in the Images plugin (where we want to conditionally avoid proxying any command if it looks like it contains an image element).</p>"},{"location":"developing/build-plugins/#throw-webdriver-specific-errors","title":"Throw WebDriver-specific errors","text":"<p>The WebDriver spec defines a set of error codes to accompany command responses if an error occurred.

You do this by assigning the <code>newMethodMap</code> static variable in your driver class to an object of the same form as Appium's <code>routes.js</code> object. For example, here is part of the <code>newMethodMap</code> for the <code>FakePlugin</code> example driver:</p> <pre><code>static newMethodMap = {\n  '/session/:sessionId/fake_data': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakeSessionData', neverProxy: true},\n    POST: {\n      command: 'setFakeSessionData',\n      payloadParams: {required: ['data']},\n      neverProxy: true,\n    },\n  },\n  '/session/:sessionId/fakepluginargs': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakePluginArgs', neverProxy: true},\n  },\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>If you're using TypeScript, static member objects like these should be defined <code>as const</code>.</p> <p>In this example we're adding a few new routes and a total of 3 new commands. For more examples of how to define commands in this way, it's best to have a look through <code>routes.js</code>. Now all you need to do is implement the command handlers in the same way you'd implement any other Appium command.</p> <p>Note also the special <code>neverProxy</code> key for commands; this is generally a good idea to set to <code>true</code> for plugins, since your plugin might be active for a driver that is put into proxy mode but hasn't bothered to decline proxying for these (new and therefore unknown) commands. Setting <code>neverProxy</code> to <code>true</code> here will cause Appium to never proxy these routes and therefore ensure your plugin handles them, even if a driver is in proxy mode.</p> <p>The downside of adding new commands via <code>newMethodMap</code> is that people using the standard Appium clients won't have nice client-side functions designed to target these endpoints. So you would need to create and release client-side plugins for each language you want to support (directions or examples can be found at the relevant client docs).</p> <p>An alternative to this way of doing things is to overload a command which all WebDriver clients have access to already: Execute Script. Make sure to read the section on adding new commands in the Building Drivers guide to understand the way this works in general. The way it works with plugins is only slightly different. Let's look at an example taken from Appium's <code>fake-plugin</code>:</p> <pre><code>static executeMethodMap = {\n  'fake: plugMeIn': {\n    command: 'plugMeIn',\n    params: {required: ['socket']},\n  },\n};\n\nasync plugMeIn(next, driver, socket) {\n  return `Plugged in to ${socket}`;\n}\n\nasync execute(next, driver, script, args) {\n  return await this.executeMethod(next, driver, script, args);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We have three important components shown here which make this system work, all of which are defined inside the plugin class:</p> <ol> <li>The <code>executeMethodMap</code>, defined in just the same way as for drivers</li> <li>The implementation of the command method as defined in <code>executeMethodMap</code> (in this case,    <code>plugMeIn</code>)</li> <li>The overriding/handling of the <code>execute</code> command. Just like any plugin command handlers, the first two arguments are <code>next</code> and <code>driver</code>, followed by the script name and args. <code>BasePlugin</code> implements a helper method which we can simply call with all of these arguments.</li> </ol> <p>Overriding Execute Methods from drivers works as you'd expect: if your plugin defines an Execute Method with the same name as that of a driver, your command (in this case <code>plugMeIn</code>) will be called first. You can choose to run the driver's original behaviour via <code>next</code> if you want.</p>"},{"location":"developing/build-plugins/#build-appium-doctor-checks","title":"Build Appium Doctor checks","text":"<p>Your users can run <code>appium plugin doctor &lt;pluginName&gt;</code> to run installation and health checks.

However, the additional complexity of mixing \"modes\" within a single application can make it difficult for automation tools that are designed to target the \"native\" elements and behaviours.</p> <p>Appium provides a set of APIs for working with different app modes, called \"contexts\", that Appium drivers can implement if they support automation commands in these different modes. There are three basic commands that Appium has added to the W3C WebDriver spec for this purpose:</p> Command Name Method/Route Params Description Returns <code>Get Contexts</code> <code>GET /session/:id/contexts</code> Get a list of the available contexts <code>array&lt;string&gt;</code> <code>Get Current Context</code> <code>GET /session/:id/context</code> Get the name of the active context <code>string</code> <code>Set Context</code> <code>POST /session/:id/context</code> <code>name</code> (<code>string</code>) Switch into the context with the given <code>name</code> <code>null</code> <p>This API is flexible enough to handle a variety of semantic interpretations on the part of the driver. For example, the XCUITest driver includes two kinds of contexts: the native app context and any active webviews, as one context per webview. A call to <code>Get Contexts</code> will return the list of names, which you as a test author can sift through and use to switch into the appropriate context. As another example, the Appium Altunity Plugin introduces the concept of a <code>UNITY</code> context, which encapsulates all the plugin's specific behaviour to ensure that when outside of the <code>UNITY</code> context, the active driver's usual command implementations are used.</p> <p>It is important to note that a call to <code>Get Contexts</code> will always contain at least one context, conventionally but not necessarily named <code>NATIVE_APP</code>. This is the default active context.</p> <p>Depending on the type of context you're in, the operation of the driver might change. The XCUITest driver, when targeting a webview context, will not run its typical routines for finding and interacting with elements. Instead, it will run a different set of routines appropriate to web elements. This might have a variety of consequences, like supporting a different set of locator strategies.</p> <p>The command names in the table above are generic references to the commands and not code examples.

There are two main strategies for this:</p> <ol> <li>Appium drivers define new W3C-compatible API routes, and Appium clients are updated to include    support for those new routes.</li> <li>Appium drivers define so-called \"Execute Methods\" which provide new functionality by    overloading the existing <code>Execute Script</code> command which is already available in any WebDriver-    based client library (including all Selenium and Appium clients).</li> </ol> <p>There are pros and cons for each strategy, but it is ultimately up to the extension author to decide how they wish implement new commands. </p> <p>This guide is designed to specifically help you understand the \"Execute Method\" strategy.  This pattern is commonly used in official Appium drivers and other third-party extensions. Here's an example of how the <code>Execute Script</code> command is designed to work in the world of WebDriver and browser automation:</p> JS (WebDriverIO)JavaPythonRubyC# <pre><code>await driver.executeScript('return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', [3, 4])\n</code></pre> <pre><code>JavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njsDriver.executeScript(\"return arguments[0] + arguments[1]\", 3, 4);\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script('return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', 3, 4)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script 'return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', 3, 4\n</code></pre> <pre><code>((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(\"return arguments[0] + arguments[1]\", 3, 4);\n</code></pre> <p>What's happening here is that we are defining a snippet of Javascript (technically, a function body) to be executed within the web browser. The client can send arguments which are serialized, sent over HTTP, and finally provided to the function as parameters.  In this example, we are essentially defining an addition function. The return value of the <code>Execute Script</code> command is whatever the return value of the Javascript snippet is! In the case of this example, that value would be the number <code>7</code> (<code>3</code> + <code>4</code>).</p> <p>Each client library has its own way of calling the command and providing any arguments to the script function, but the function itself\u2014the snippet\u2014is always a string and is the same across all languages.</p> <p>In the world of Appium, we are usually not automating a web browser, which means this command is not particularly useful. But it is useful as a way to encode the name of an arbitrary command and to provide parameters. For example, the XCUITest Driver has implemented a command that lets a client terminate a running application if you know the ID (the <code>bundleId</code>) of the app. The way that the driver makes this command available is via the Execute Method <code>mobile: terminateApp</code>. Instead of providing a JavaScript function to the \"Execute Script\" command, the user provides a known string as defined by the driver. The only other thing a client needs to know is the set of parameters for the method, which are documented by the driver. In this case, we have a parameter named <code>bundleId</code>, whose value should be a string encoding the ID of the app to terminate. Here is how this Execute Method would be called:</p> JS (WebDriverIO)JavaPythonRubyC# <pre><code>await driver.executeScript('mobile: terminateApp', [{bundleId: 'com.my.app'}])\n</code></pre> <pre><code>JavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njsDriver.executeScript(\"mobile: terminateApp\", ImmutableMap.of(\"bundleId\", \"com.my.app\"));\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script('mobile: terminateApp', {'bundleId': 'com.my.app'})\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script 'mobile: terminateApp', { bundleId: 'com.my.app' }\n</code></pre> <pre><code>((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(\"mobile: terminateApp\",\n    new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { \"bundleId\", \"com.my.app\" } });\n</code></pre> <p>There are two important differences in using Appium Execute Methods from vanilla Selenium Javascript execution:</p> <ol> <li>The script string is just a command name; it will be provided by the driver documentation</li> <li>The standard way to provide parameters is as a single object with keys representing parameter    names and values representing parameter values. So in this case, we had to specify both the    parameter name (<code>bundleId</code>) as the key of the parameters object, and the parameter value    (<code>com.my.app</code>) as the value for that key. A driver can define parameters as required or optional.</li> </ol> <p>Of course, always refer to the documentation for the particular Execute Method in case the author has made any alterations to the standard access method.</p>"},{"location":"guides/grid/","title":"Appium and Selenium Grid","text":""},{"location":"guides/grid/#using-selenium-grid-4","title":"Using Selenium Grid 4+","text":"<p>The relay feature in Grid 4 allows you to proxy Appium requests to an Appium server instance.

The Extension CLI comes with a variety of commands and parameters; see the documentation for that command for all the specifics.</p> <p>The all-important question when Appium is managing your extensions for you is: where are they installed? Appium manages extensions in a directory specified by the <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> environment variable. You can set that variable to anything you like, and Appium will manage its extensions there. You can therefore also use the <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> environment variable to manage different sets of extensions, for example if you want to have the same driver installed at conflicting versions:</p> <pre><code>APPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home1 appium driver install xcuitest@4.11.1\nAPPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home2 appium driver install xcuitest@4.11.2\n</code></pre> <p>Running these commands will result in two separate <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> directories being created and populated with the corresponding version of the XCUITest driver. You can then use the same environment variables to direct Appium which version to use on launch:</p> <pre><code>APPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home1 appium  # use xcuitest driver 4.11.1\nAPPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home2 appium  # use xcuitest driver 4.11.2\n</code></pre> <p>You don't need to set <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> if you don't want to!

If you're using an updated Appium client (at least one maintained by the Appium team), the client will add the <code>appium:</code> prefix for you on all necessary capabilities automatically.
