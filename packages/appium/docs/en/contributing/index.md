This section of Appium's documentation is for those who are interested in contributing to Appium's
development. It contains developer overviews, guides, and notes. Use the navigation menu to find
a specific topic. All the information in these guides assumes in-depth familiarity with Appium
already.

!!! warning

    Developer information may not be kept up to date as frequently as user-facing information, or
    it may be most relevant in its current form on the online repository, not in this published
    version. Always be sure to check the repo or discuss with maintainers. We're always happy to
    help new contributors get started!
