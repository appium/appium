title: Appium-Related Tools
---

There are several Appium tools that have been created to to assist with things not directly related
to testing, such as Appium installation, test development, and more.

### Appium Inspector

Appium has a graphical client which can be used to inspect application screenshots, view the
application hierarchy, run Appium commands, record app interactions, and more. It is very useful
for Appium test development.

### Appium Doctor

The `appium-doctor` CLI tool can be used to validate proper environment setup for Android and iOS
automation, and identify any common configuration issues.
