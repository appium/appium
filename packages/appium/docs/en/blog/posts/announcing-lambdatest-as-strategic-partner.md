# Announcing TestMu AI (formerly LambdaTest) as Appium Strategic Partner

After recently celebrating the 1-year anniversary of our [Sponsorship Program and Compensation
Scheme](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/blog/2024/05/14/announcing-appiums-sponsorship-program/),
the Appium project is very excited to announce that <a href="https://www.testmuai.com/blog/testmu-as-appium-strategic-partner/">TestMu AI (formerly LambdaTest)</a> is coming on board as one of our Strategic Partners!

Having long been active in the Appium community and the automated testing industry, TestMu AI is
now significantly stepping up their investment into these areas. With the decision to come on board
as a Strategic Partner, TestMu AI will support the Appium project through financial contribution
as well as contribution of code and project maintenance. Obviously, without the generous support of
partners like TestMu AI, we would not be able to continue our contributor compensation scheme,
which has seen the release of a substantial amount of funds to Appium maintainers and contributors
over the last year. Thanks again to TestMu AI, and stay tuned for more collaboration updates
throughout the year!
