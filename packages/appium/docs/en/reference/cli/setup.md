Installs a specific preset of extensions (drivers and plugins), or uninstalls all extensions.
When installing a preset, any already installed extensions are kept intact.

The following sub-subcommands are supported: `browser`, `desktop`, `mobile`, and `reset`.

Refer to the [Ecosystem documentation](../../ecosystem/index.md) to learn more about the extensions
mentioned below.

## `browser`

Installs the following extensions for browser webview testing:

* Drivers: `safari`[^1], `gecko`, `chromium`
* Plugins: `images`

#### Usage

```
appium setup browser
```

## `desktop`

Installs the following extensions for desktop application testing:

* Drivers: `mac2`[^1], `windows`[^2]
* Plugins: `images`

#### Usage

```
appium setup desktop
```

## `mobile`

Installs the following extensions for mobile testing:

* Drivers: `uiautomator2`, `xcuitest`[^1], `espresso`

You can also omit the `mobile` sub-subcommand:

## `reset`

directory. This can be useful if you experience configuration issues on server startup, for
example, due to a failed upgrade attempt from an older Appium version.
