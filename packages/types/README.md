# @appium/types

> A collection of TypeScript type declarations used across various [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) packages.

**Warning: This is a work-in-progress; expect breaking changes!**

## Install

```bash
npm install @appium/types -D
```

## Notes

- The sources are `.ts` files, _not_ `.d.ts` files. This allows other packages in the root TypeScript "project" to define a dependency upon this one, and enables incremental builds an "watch" mode.
- If there is a way to switch to `.d.ts` files and configure this package to work in our "project" context _without_ needing to actually "emit" anything, then we should do that instead.  Help accepted!
- `lib/appium-config.ts` is generated by this package from `@appium/schema`, but is under version control to avoid chicken-or-egg build problems.
