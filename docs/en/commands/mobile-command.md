An optional `maxSwipes` property can limit the number of scroll actions. It accepts an optional `element` property which should be the element identifier and scrollable. Without this property, Appium will select the first currently available scrollable container. Please read `mobileScroll` section in [appium-uiautomator2-driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver/blob/master/lib/commands/general.js) for more details. | `{element, strategy, selector, maxSwipes}` | `{strategy: 'accessibility id', selector: 'target content description'}` |

| mobile:type | Types the given Unicode string into focused field. The combination of `unicodeKeyboard` capability and the [send keys](https://appium.io/docs/en/commands/element/actions/send-keys/) works as _replacing_ the text field content. The send key in W3C action works only for ASCII. This command helps such cases to append unicode text content against the focused field. | `{text}` | `{text: 'happy testing'}` |
