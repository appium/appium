title: Appium Clients
---

You need a client to write and run Appium scripts. You'll want to become very
familiar with your client documentation (as well as the documentation of any Selenium client that
the Appium client depends on) since that will be your primary interface to Appium.

To learn more about clients, check out the [Client Intro](../intro/clients.md).

## Official Clients

These clients are currently maintained by the Appium team:

### [Java Client](https://github.com/appium/java-client)

Language: :fontawesome-brands-java: Java

\=== "Setup With Maven"

````
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
  <version>${version.you.require}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
````

Language: :fontawesome-brands-python: Python

```

### [Ruby Core Client](https://github.com/appium/ruby_lib_core)

Language: :material-language-ruby: Ruby

```sh title="Install From RubyGems"
gem install appium_lib_core
```

### [Ruby Client](https://github.com/appium/ruby_lib)

Language: :material-language-ruby: Ruby

This client is a wrapper for the Ruby Core Client with several helper methods, though this may
add additional complexity, therefore the Ruby Core Client is recommended instead.

```sh title="Install From RubyGems"
gem install appium_lib
```

### [.NET Client](https://github.com/appium/dotnet-client)

Language: :simple-dotnet: C#

```sh title="Install Using .NET CLI"
dotnet add package Appium.WebDriver
```

## Other Clients

These clients are not maintained by the Appium team and can be used with other languages.

In general, any W3C WebDriver spec-compatible client will also integrate well with Appium, though
some Appium-specific commands may not be implemented in other clients.
