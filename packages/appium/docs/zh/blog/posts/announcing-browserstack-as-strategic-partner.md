BrowserStack has long been recognized in the industry as having extensive support for Appium,
allowing you to run functional and visual regression tests for your native and hybrid apps at scale
across a variety of devices and platforms.

As a token of this collaboration, BrowserStack is extending a special premium access of
BrowserStack App Automate product to Appium users. Discover more about this special offer at

With the decision to come on board as Strategic Partner, BrowserStack is making a huge investment
in Appium and the Appium community. BrowserStack is very interested in supporting the development
of the Appium contributor base, and is proud to be a key part of our contributor compensation
scheme. Without Strategic Partners like BrowserStack, we would not be able to maintain such
a program! We welcome them with gratitude!
