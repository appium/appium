title: Contributing to Appium
---

Appium is open source, available under an Apache 2.0 license. Appium's copyright is held by the
[OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org), and Appium receives contributions from many companies
across several software industries, regardless of their competitive status. (3rd-party drivers and
plugins are available under the licenses provided by their authors.)

As such, we welcome contributions! The project moves forward in relation to the investment of
contributions of code, documentation, maintenance, and support from companies and volunteers.

This section of Appium's documentation is for those who are interested in contributing to Appium's
development. It contains developer overviews, guides, and notes. Use the navigation menu to find
a specific topic. All the information in these guides assumes in-depth familiarity with Appium
already.

!!! warning

    Developer information may not be kept up to date as frequently as user-facing information, or
    it may be most relevant in its current form on the online repository, not in this published
    version. Always be sure to check the repo or discuss with maintainers. We're always happy to
    help new contributors get started!
