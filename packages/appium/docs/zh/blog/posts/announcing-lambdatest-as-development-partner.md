# Announcing TestMu AI (formerly LambdaTest) as Appium's Newest Development Partner

As part of our ongoing effort to recognize organizations that meaningfully support the Appium project through dedicated maintainer time, we are excited to welcome our newest Development Partner: TestMu AI (formerly LambdaTest)!
TestMu AI has long been an active participant in the automated testing ecosystem. Today, they are officially formalizing their commitment by investing people—dedicated engineers who will directly support Appium's development, maintenance, and ecosystem growth.
This kind of hands-on contribution is crucial for ensuring Appium continues to evolve. We deeply value partners who empower their engineering teams to contribute code directly to open source rather than just sponsorship.
