Effective immediately we are fortunate and excited to be able to welcome a new Strategic Partner to the Appium project: Sauce Labs!</p> <p>Sauce Labs has a long history of support for the Appium project. In fact, Appium was initially incubated at Sauce Labs under the direction of @jlipps, in the early days of mobile automation. Sauce Labs always envisioned Appium as being a project for and by the community, and cemented this perspective in 2016 with the donation of Appium to the JS Foundation (now the OpenJS Foundation). To this day, developers associated with Sauce Labs continue to help maintain various parts of the Appium project.</p> <p>Now, Sauce Labs is making a further commitment to support Appium financially as a way to enable our new contributor compensation program. We're very excited about this program as a vehicle for getting more people involved in Appium's development and maintenance.

This program is now officially launching! Let's dive into some of the details.</p> <p>First of all, the details and fine print will always be available at Appium's Governance document, which outlines how the project is run, who makes project decisions, etc... This document will be kept up to date with the latest details of the program, so that's the place to bookmark for reference!</p> <p>As of now, Appium has opened up sponsorship opportunities via our OpenCollective page. OpenCollective is a service which allows people to donate to open source groups. We've defined a number of giving tiers for donations, within a very wide range, and welcome any financial amount with gratitude! Based on the donation tier, sponsorship comes with a variety of benefits, including recognition at different places in the Appium repo, docs, and website. In addition to financial sponsorship, the project has decided to recognize significant donations of project leadership and maintenance efforts from companies who have invested heavily into Appium with their employees' time (we call these \"Development Partners\").</p> <p>What will the project do with the funds raised through this sponsorship program? We aim to give it all back to the Appium community! With the details again available at our Governance document, we have implemented a scheme very much inspired by our friends at WebdriverIO (thanks WDIO friends!) There are three groups of contributors to Appium that this scheme supports: (1) project maintainers (those who devote consistent time to leading the project), (2) project contributors (anyone in the wider community that contributes code or documentation), and (3) upstream projects (other open source projects Appium relies heavily on to work well). Each month, the funds raised via sponsorship will be distributed in different amounts to each of these groups. So if you make a valuable contribution to Appium moving forward, you'll be eligible to get some cash as a thank-you! (You'll need to have your own OpenCollective account in good standing to receive funds).</p> <p>We're very excited about this new program, and hope that it helps existing and new contributors to feel even better about donating their time to making Appium better. And of course, none of this would be possible without the amazing Partners and Sponsors we hope to attract! On that note, stay tuned over the next few weeks as we unveil some of our initial program launch Partners! And if you or your company would like to participate by supporting Appium financially, you are most welcome. Just head over to our OpenCollective page and choose the tier that reflects your desired contribution level.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/08/07/-appium-3/","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Appium 3","text":"<p>Appium 3 is here \u2014 and while it's not as massive a leap as Appium 2, it introduces a few essential breaking changes that developers and QA engineers should be aware of.</p> <p>The main idea behind Appium 3 is to clear out old cruft so that Appium can be leaner moving forward, and rely on newer versions of software with better performance and security characteristics. We're also getting rid of legacy behaviors and protocols that we deprecated as part of Appium 2.</p> <p>For you as a user, there's not much to worry about. The breaking changes are minimal:</p> <ul> <li>Node.js / NPM minimum version bump (to 20.19 / 10)</li> <li>Removal of certain deprecated endpoints</li> <li>Security feature flag prefix requirements (e.g. <code>adb_shell</code> to <code>uiautomator2:adb_shell</code>)</li> </ul> <p>In terms of new features, we've been adding them incrementally rather than saving them up for Appium 3. But with this release we are excited to share these new capabilities:</p> <ul> <li><code>appium plugin install inspector</code> (Use Appium to host the Inspector rather than downloading it as a separate app)</li> <li>Clients can set the <code>X-Appium-Is-Sensitive</code> HTTP header on requests to direct the server to mask the data in the request in the logs, so that when you send a password into an input box, the password's actual value is not logged in plaintext. (Learn more)</li> </ul> <p>Of course, we have a full Appium 3 migration guide to make sure you know all the details and can deeply understand the consequences of upgrading to Appium 3 in your environment.</p> <p>Ready to make the leap?

For example, the Appium UiAutomator2 driver interfaces with a special (Java-based) server running on the Android device. In webview mode, it also interfaces with Chromedriver.</p> <p>If you find yourself in this situation, it is extremely easy to tell Appium that your driver is just going to be proxying WebDriver commands straight to another endpoint.</p> <p>First, let Appium know that your driver can proxy by implementing the <code>canProxy</code> method:</p> <pre><code>canProxy() {\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, tell Appium which WebDriver routes it should not attempt to proxy (there often end up being certain routes that you don't want to forward on):</p> <pre><code>getProxyAvoidList() {\n    return [\n        ['POST', new RegExp('^/session/[^/]+/appium')]\n    ];\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The proxy avoidance list should be an array of arrays, where each inner array has an HTTP method as its first member, and a regular expression as its second. If the regular expression matches the route, then the route will not be proxied and instead will be handled by your driver. In this example, we are avoiding proxying all <code>POST</code> routes that have the <code>appium</code> prefix.</p> <p>Next, we have to set up the proxying itself. The way to do this is to use a special class from Appium called <code>JWProxy</code>. (The name means \"JSON Wire Proxy\" and is related to a legacy implementation of the protocol). You'll want to create a <code>JWProxy</code> object using the details required to connect to the remote server:</p> <pre><code>// import {JWProxy} from 'appium/driver';\n\nconst proxy = new JWProxy({\n    server: 'remote.server',\n    port: 1234,\n    base: '/',\n});\n\nthis.proxyReqRes = proxy.proxyReqRes.bind(proxy);\nthis.proxyCommand = proxy.command.bind(proxy);\n</code></pre> <p>Here we are creating a proxy object and assigning some of its methods to <code>this</code> under the names <code>proxyReqRes</code> and <code>proxyCommand</code>. This is required for Appium to use the proxy, so don't forget this step! The <code>JWProxy</code> has a variety of other options which you can check out in the source code, as well. (TODO: publish options as API docs and link here).</p> <p>Finally, we need a way to tell Appium when the proxy is active. For your driver it might always be active, or it might only be active when in a certain context. You can define the logic as an implementation of <code>proxyActive</code>:</p> <pre><code>proxyActive() {\n    return true; // or use custom logic\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With those pieces in play, you won't have to reimplement anything that's already implemented by the remote endpoint you're proxying to.

Once all this is in place, Appium will proxy BiDi commands from the client straight to the upstream connection.</p>"},{"location":"developing/build-drivers/#extend-the-existing-protocol-with-new-commands","title":"Extend the existing protocol with new commands","text":"<p>You may find that the existing commands don't cut it for your driver. If you want to expose behaviours that don't map to any of the existing commands, you can create new commands in one of three ways:</p> <ol> <li>Extending the classic WebDriver protocol and creating client-side plugins to access the extensions via the classic HTTP interface</li> <li>Extending the WebDriver BiDi protocol with new modules and methods, accessed from a client via the BiDi interface</li> <li>Overloading the Execute Script command by defining Execute    Methods</li> </ol> <p>If you want to follow the first path, you can direct Appium to recognize new methods and add them to its set of allowed HTTP routes and command names. You do this by assigning the <code>newMethodMap</code> static variable in your driver class to an object of the same form as Appium's <code>routes.js</code> object. For example, here is the <code>newMethodMap</code> for the <code>FakeDriver</code> example driver:</p> <pre><code>static newMethodMap = {\n  '/session/:sessionId/fakedriver': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakeThing'},\n    POST: {command: 'setFakeThing', payloadParams: {required: ['thing']}},\n  },\n  '/session/:sessionId/fakedriverargs': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakeDriverArgs'},\n  },\n};\n</code></pre> <p>In this example we're adding a few new routes and a total of 3 new commands. For more examples of how to define commands in this way, it's best to have a look through <code>routes.js</code>. Now all you need to do is implement the command handlers in the same way you'd implement any other Appium command.</p> <p>The downside of this way of adding new commands is that people using the standard Appium clients won't have nice client-side functions designed to target these endpoints. So you would need to create and release client-side plugins for each language you want to support (directions or examples can be found at the relevant client docs).</p> <p>The second way of adding new commands is adding them as BiDi commands (accessed via the BiDi websocket interface, rather than the classic HTTP interface). BiDi commands come in two parts: a \"module\", which is basically a container or namespace, and a \"command\", which is the name of your new command.</p> <p>As with the first method, you teach Appium to recognize your new BiDi commands by adding a static field to your driver class, called <code>newBidiCommands</code>. It has a format similar to <code>newMethodMap</code>. Basically it encapsulates information about the BiDi module, BiDi command name, reference to your driver instance method that will handle the command, and required and optional parameters. Here's an example of a <code>newBidiCommands</code> as implemented on an imaginary driver:</p> <pre><code>static newBidiCommands = {\n  'appium:video': {\n    startFramerateCapture: {\n      command: 'startFrameCap',\n      params: {\n        required: ['videoSource'],\n        optional: ['showOnScreen'],\n      }\n    },\n    stopFramerateCapture: {\n      command: 'stopFrameCap',\n    },\n  }\n};\n</code></pre> <p>In this imaginary example, we have defined two new BiDi commands: <code>appium:video.startFramerateCapture</code> and <code>appium:video.stopFramerateCapture</code>. Note first of all that, because we are defining a custom BiDi command, we should include a 'vendor prefix' (in this case, <code>appium:</code>, though you should pick something that represents your project). The first command takes a required and an optional parameter, and the second does not. When combined with generic BiDi support in your driver (see the section on BiDi above), and given an implementation of the appropriate methods on your driver (e.g. <code>startFrameCap</code> and <code>stopFrameCap</code> in this example), clients would be able to send these BiDi commands using whatever mechanism normally exists for doing so in the client library.</p> <p>An alternative to these other ways of doing things is to overload a command which all WebDriver clients have access to already: Execute Script. Appium provides some a convenient tool for making this easy. Let's say you are building a driver for stereo system called <code>soundz</code>, and you wanted to create a command for playing a song by name. You could expose this to your users in such a way that they call something like:</p> <pre><code>// webdriverio example. Calling webdriverio's `executeScript` command is what trigger's Appium's\n// Execute Script command handler\ndriver.executeScript('soundz: playSong', [{song: 'Stairway to Heaven', artist: 'Led Zeppelin'}]);\n</code></pre> <p>Then in your driver code you can define the static property <code>executeMethodMap</code> as a mapping of script names to methods on your driver. It has the same basic form as <code>newMethodMap</code>, described above. Once <code>executeMethodMap</code> is defined, you'll also need to implement the Execute Script command handler, which according to Appium's routes mapping is called <code>execute</code>. The implementation can call a single helper function, <code>this.executeMethod</code>, which takes care of looking at the script and arguments the user sent in and routing it to the correct custom handler you've defined.

It creates a function which calls <code>validate(value, ref)</code> (in <code>lib/schema/schema.js</code>) where <code>value</code> is whatever the user provided, and <code>ref</code> is the <code>ref</code> property of the <code>ArgSpec</code>. The concept is that <code>ajv</code> can validate using any <code>ref</code> it knows about; each property in a schema can be referenced by this <code>ref</code> whether it's defined or not. To help visualize, if a schema is:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"$id\": \"my-schema.json\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>ref</code> of <code>foo</code> would be <code>my-schema.json#/properties/foo</code>.

Depending on which client you are using, the prefix may be added automatically or in conjunction with certain interfaces, but it is always a good practice to explicitly include it for clarity.</p> <p>Here is a list of all the globally-recognized Appium capabilities:</p> <p>Info</p> <pre><code>Individual drivers and plugins can support other capabilities, so refer to their documentation\nfor lists of specific capability names. Some drivers may also not support all of these capabilities\n</code></pre> Capability Type Required? Description <code>platformName</code> <code>string</code> yes The type of platform hosting the app or browser <code>appium:automationName</code> <code>string</code> yes The name of the Appium driver to use <code>browserName</code> <code>string</code> no The name of the browser to launch and automate, if the driver supports web browsers as a special case <code>appium:app</code> <code>string</code> no The path to an installable application <code>appium:deviceName</code> <code>string</code> no The name of a particular device to automate, e.g., <code>iPhone 14</code> (currently only actually useful for specifying iOS simulators, since in other situations it's typically recommended to use a specific device id via the <code>appium:udid</code> capability). <code>appium:platformVersion</code> <code>string</code> no The version of a platform, e.g., for iOS, <code>16.0</code> <code>appium:newCommandTimeout</code> <code>number</code> no The number of seconds the Appium server should wait for clients to send commands before deciding that the client has gone away and the session should shut down. <code>60</code> seconds by default. Setting it to zero disables the timer. <code>appium:noReset</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, instruct an Appium driver to avoid its usual reset logic during session start and cleanup (default <code>false</code>) <code>appium:fullReset</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, instruct an Appium driver to augment its usual reset logic with additional steps to ensure maximum environmental reproducibility (default <code>false</code>) <code>appium:eventTimings</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, instruct an Appium driver to collect Event Timings (default <code>false</code>) <code>appium:printPageSourceOnFindFailure</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, collect the page source and print it to the Appium log whenever a request to find an element fails (default <code>false</code>) <p>Some drivers place more complex constraints on capabilities as a group. For example, while the <code>appium:app</code> and <code>browserName</code> capabilities are listed above as optional, if you want to launch a session with a specific app, the XCUITest driver requires that at least one of <code>appium:app</code>, <code>browserName</code>, or <code>appium:bundleId</code> are included in the capabilities (otherwise it will not know what app to install and/or launch and will simply open a session on the home screen). Each driver will document how it interprets these capabilities and any other platform-specific requirements.</p> <p>Note</p> <pre><code>Capabilities are like parameters used when starting a session. After the capabilities are sent\nand the session is started, they cannot be changed. If a driver supports updating aspects of\nits behaviour in the course of a session, it will provide a [Setting](./settings.md) for this\npurpose instead of, or in addition to, a capability.\n</code></pre> <p>Each Appium client has its own way of constructing capabilities and starting a session.

However, the additional complexity of mixing \"modes\" within a single application can make it difficult for automation tools that are designed to target the \"native\" elements and behaviours.</p> <p>Appium provides a set of APIs for working with different app modes, called \"contexts\", that Appium drivers can implement if they support automation commands in these different modes.

For example, the XCUITest driver includes two kinds of contexts: the native app context and any active webviews, as one context per webview. A call to <code>Get Contexts</code> will return the list of names, which you as a test author can sift through and use to switch into the appropriate context. As another example, the Appium Altunity Plugin introduces the concept of a <code>UNITY</code> context, which encapsulates all the plugin's specific behaviour to ensure that when outside of the <code>UNITY</code> context, the active driver's usual command implementations are used.</p> <p>It is important to note that a call to <code>Get Contexts</code> will always contain at least one context, conventionally but not necessarily named <code>NATIVE_APP</code>. This is the default active context.</p> <p>Depending on the type of context you're in, the operation of the driver might change. The XCUITest driver, when targeting a webview context, will not run its typical routines for finding and interacting with elements. Instead, it will run a different set of routines appropriate to web elements. This might have a variety of consequences, like supporting a different set of locator strategies.</p> <p>The command names in the table above are generic references to the commands and not code examples.

There are two main strategies for this:</p> <ol> <li>Appium drivers define new W3C-compatible API routes, and Appium clients are updated to include    support for those new routes.</li> <li>Appium drivers define so-called \"Execute Methods\" which provide new functionality by    overloading the existing <code>Execute Script</code> command which is already available in any WebDriver-    based client library (including all Selenium and Appium clients).</li> </ol> <p>There are pros and cons for each strategy, but it is ultimately up to the extension author to decide how they wish implement new commands.</p> <p>This guide is designed to specifically help you understand the \"Execute Method\" strategy.  This pattern is commonly used in official Appium drivers and other third-party extensions. Here's an example of how the <code>Execute Script</code> command is designed to work in the world of WebDriver and browser automation:</p> <p>=== \"JS (WebDriverIO)\"</p> <pre><code>```js\nawait driver.executeScript('return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', [3, 4])\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Java\"</p> <pre><code>```java\nJavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njsDriver.executeScript(\"return arguments[0] + arguments[1]\", 3, 4);\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Python\"</p> <pre><code>```py\ndriver.execute_script('return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', 3, 4)\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Ruby\"</p> <pre><code>```rb\ndriver.execute_script 'return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', 3, 4\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"C#\"</p> <pre><code>```dotnet\n((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(\"return arguments[0] + arguments[1]\", 3, 4);\n```\n</code></pre> <p>What's happening here is that we are defining a snippet of Javascript (technically, a function body) to be executed within the web browser. The client can send arguments which are serialized, sent over HTTP, and finally provided to the function as parameters.  In this example, we are essentially defining an addition function. The return value of the <code>Execute Script</code> command is whatever the return value of the Javascript snippet is! In the case of this example, that value would be the number <code>7</code> (<code>3</code> + <code>4</code>).</p> <p>Each client library has its own way of calling the command and providing any arguments to the script function, but the function itself\u2014the snippet\u2014is always a string and is the same across all languages.</p> <p>In the world of Appium, we are usually not automating a web browser, which means this command is not particularly useful. But it is useful as a way to encode the name of an arbitrary command and to provide parameters. For example, the XCUITest Driver has implemented a command that lets a client terminate a running application if you know the ID (the <code>bundleId</code>) of the app. The way that the driver makes this command available is via the Execute Method <code>mobile: terminateApp</code>. Instead of providing a JavaScript function to the \"Execute Script\" command, the user provides a known string as defined by the driver. The only other thing a client needs to know is the set of parameters for the method, which are documented by the driver. In this case, we have a parameter named <code>bundleId</code>, whose value should be a string encoding the ID of the app to terminate. Here is how this Execute Method would be called:</p> <p>=== \"JS (WebDriverIO)\"</p> <pre><code>```js\nawait driver.executeScript('mobile: terminateApp', [{bundleId: 'com.my.app'}])\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Java\"</p> <pre><code>```java\nJavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njsDriver.executeScript(\"mobile: terminateApp\", ImmutableMap.of(\"bundleId\", \"com.my.app\"));\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Python\"</p> <pre><code>```py\ndriver.execute_script('mobile: terminateApp', {'bundleId': 'com.my.app'})\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Ruby\"</p> <pre><code>```rb\ndriver.execute_script 'mobile: terminateApp', { bundleId: 'com.my.app' }\n```\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"C#\"</p> <pre><code>```dotnet\n((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(\"mobile: terminateApp\",\n    new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { \"bundleId\", \"com.my.app\" } });\n\n```\n</code></pre> <p>There are two important differences in using Appium Execute Methods from vanilla Selenium Javascript execution:</p> <ol> <li>The script string is just a command name; it will be provided by the driver documentation</li> <li>The standard way to provide parameters is as a single object with keys representing parameter    names and values representing parameter values. So in this case, we had to specify both the    parameter name (<code>bundleId</code>) as the key of the parameters object, and the parameter value    (<code>com.my.app</code>) as the value for that key. A driver can define parameters as required or optional.</li> </ol> <p>Of course, always refer to the documentation for the particular Execute Method in case the author has made any alterations to the standard access method.</p>"},{"location":"guides/grid/","title":"Appium and Selenium Grid","text":""},{"location":"guides/grid/#using-selenium-grid-4","title":"Using Selenium Grid 4+","text":"<p>The relay feature in Grid 4 allows you to proxy Appium requests to an Appium server instance.

Here's an example of how you might install a driver using the CLI:</p> <pre><code>appium driver install xcuitest\n</code></pre> <p>This command will install the latest version of the XCUITest Driver. The Extension CLI comes with a variety of commands and parameters; see the documentation for that command for all the specifics.</p> <p>The all-important question when Appium is managing your extensions for you is: where are they installed? Appium manages extensions in a directory specified by the <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> environment variable. You can set that variable to anything you like, and Appium will manage its extensions there. You can therefore also use the <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> environment variable to manage different sets of extensions, for example if you want to have the same driver installed at conflicting versions:</p> <pre><code>APPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home1 appium driver install xcuitest@4.11.1\nAPPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home2 appium driver install xcuitest@4.11.2\n</code></pre> <p>Running these commands will result in two separate <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> directories being created and populated with the corresponding version of the XCUITest driver. You can then use the same environment variables to direct Appium which version to use on launch:</p> <pre><code>APPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home1 appium  # use xcuitest driver 4.11.1\nAPPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home2 appium  # use xcuitest driver 4.11.2\n</code></pre> <p>You don't need to set <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> if you don't want to! By default, Appium will set <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> to the directory <code>.appium</code> in your user home directory.</p> <p>These installed packages will be managed by <code>extensions.yaml</code> in <code>$APPIUM_HOME/node_modules/.cache/appium/extensions.yaml</code>.</p>"},{"location":"guides/managing-exts/#do-it-yourself-with-npm","title":"Do-It-Yourself with <code>npm</code>","text":"<p>Because Appium and Appium drivers are Node.js programs, if you are integrating your Appium scripts into your own Node.js project, there is an alternative way to manage drivers and plugins: via <code>npm</code>, like any other dependency.

They do not affect   the device or app under test</li> </ul> <p>An example of a setting would be the <code>ignoreUnimportantViews</code> setting recognized by the UiAutomator2 driver. The driver can be instructed to ignore elements in the view hierarchy which it deems irrelevant. Changing this setting to <code>true</code> can cause tests to run faster. But if later in the same session you want to access elements which would be ignored under this setting, you can always change it back to <code>false</code>.</p> <p>Settings are implemented via the following API endpoints:</p> Command Method/Route Params Description Returns <code>Update Settings</code> <code>POST /session/:id/appium/settings</code> <code>settings</code> (<code>Record&lt;string, any&gt;</code>) Update the provided setting values <code>null</code> <code>Get Settings</code> <code>GET /session/:id/appium/settings</code> Return the current settings <code>settings</code> (<code>Record&lt;string, any&gt;</code>) <p>The <code>settings</code> object must be a set of keys and values, where the key is the setting name, and the value is any documented valid value for that setting.</p> <p>Info</p> <pre><code>Settings are driver-specific, so refer to your driver's documentation for a list of supported settings\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/settings/#initializing-settings-via-capabilities","title":"Initializing Settings via Capabilities","text":"<p>If you want to start an Appium session with a setting in a non-default state, you can do so by including a capability of the form <code>appium:settings[&lt;name&gt;]</code> with the appropriate value.

\"drivers\" are basically Appium's answer to the question, \"how do we support automation of multiple, unrelated platforms?\" In this doc we'll get into a little more detail about how drivers work. The specific details of how drivers work probably don't matter too much for you, unless you're planning on writing your own driver or contributing to an existing driver (things we hope you do!).</p> <p>The main benefit in understanding a bit more of how drivers work is that being aware of the typical complexity or the typical driver architecture will inform your debugging process when you inevitably run into an issue in one of your tests.</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#interface-implementations","title":"Interface Implementations","text":"<p>At the most basic level, drivers are simply Node.js classes that extend a special class included in Appium, called <code>BaseDriver</code>. You could have something very close to a \"working\" driver, with these very simple lines of code:</p> <pre><code>import BaseDriver from '@appium/base-driver'\n\nclass MyNewDriver extends BaseDriver {\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This empty driver doesn't do anything, but you could wrap it up in a Node.js module, add a few Appium-related fields to the module's manifest (<code>package.json</code>), and then install it using <code>appium driver install</code>.</p> <p>So, from a technical perspective, an Appium driver is just a bit of code that inherits from some other Appium code. That's it! Now, inheriting from <code>BaseDriver</code> actually gives us a lot, because <code>BaseDriver</code> is essentially an encapsulation of the entire WebDriver protocol. So all a driver needs to do something useful is to implement Node.js methods with names corresponding to their WebDriver protocol equivalents.</p> <p>So let's say I wanted to do something with this empty driver; first I have to decide which WebDriver command I want to implement. For our example, let's take the Navigate To WebDriver command. Leave aside for the moment what I want to have the driver do when this command is executed. To tell Appium the driver can handle the command, all we have to do is define a method like this in our driver class:<sup>1</sup></p> <pre><code>async setUrl(url) {\n    // do whatever we want here\n}\n</code></pre> <p>That's it! How we actually implement the command is totally up to us, and depends on the platform(s) we want to support. Here are some different example implementations of this command for different platforms:</p> <ul> <li>Browsers: execute some JavaScript to set <code>window.location.href</code></li> <li>iOS apps: launch an app using a deep link</li> <li>Android apps: launch an app using a deep link</li> <li>React apps: load a specific route</li> <li>Unity: go to a named scene</li> </ul> <p>So you can see there can be a lot of differences between how drivers implement the same WebDriver command across platforms.<sup>2</sup> What is the same, though, is how they express that they can handle a protocol command.</p> <p>We're going into this great amount of detail (which you don't need to remember, by the way), because it's important to stress the point that an Appium driver is not inherently anything in particular, other than a bit of JS code that can handle WebDriver protocol commands. Where you go from there is up to you, the driver author!</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#automation-mapping","title":"Automation mapping","text":"<p>But typically what driver authors want to do is to provide automation behaviours for a given platform(s) that are semantically very similar to the the WebDriver spec implementations for browsers. When you want to find an element, you should get a reference to a UI element. When you want to click or tap that element, the resulting behaviour should be the same as if a person were to click or tap on the element. And so on.</p> <p>So the real challenge for driver authors is not how to work with the WebDriver protocol (because <code>BaseDriver</code> encapsulates all that for you), but how to make the actual automation happen on the target platform. Every driver relies on its own set of underlying technologies here. As mentioned in the Overview, the iOS driver uses an Apple technology called XCUITest. These underlying automation technologies usually have proprietary or idiosyncratic APIs of their own. Writing a driver becomes the task of mapping the WebDriver protocol to this underlying API (or sometimes a set of different underlying APIs--for example, the UiAutomator2 driver relies not only on the UiAutomator2 technology from Google, but also functions only available through ADB, as well as functions only available via the Android SDK inside a helper app). Tying it all together into a single, usable, WebDriver interface is the incredibly useful (but incredibly challenging) art of driver development!</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#multi-level-architecture","title":"Multi-level architecture","text":"<p>In practice, this often results in a pretty complex architecture. Let's take iOS for example again. The XCUITest framework (the one used by the Appium driver) expects code that calls it to be written in Objective-C or Swift. Furthermore, XCUITest code can only be run in a special mode triggered by Xcode (and directly or indirectly, the Xcode command line tools). In other words, there's no straightforward way to go from a Node.js function implementation (like <code>setUrl()</code> above) to XCUITest API calls.</p> <p>What the XCUITest driver authors have done is instead to split the driver into two parts: one part written in Node.js (the part which is incorporated into Appium and which initially handles the WebDriver commands), and the other part written in Objective-C (the part which actually gets run on an iOS device and makes XCUITest API calls). This makes interfacing with XCUITest possible, but introduces the new problem of coordination between the two parts.</p> <p>The driver authors could have chosen any of a number of very different strategies to model the communication between the Node.js side and the Objective-C side, but at the end of the day decided to use ... the WebDriver protocol! That's right, the Objective-C side of the XCUITest driver is itself a WebDriver implementation, called WebDriverAgent.<sup>3</sup></p> <ul> <li>The Appium XCUITest driver builds and manages WebDriverAgent for you, which can be a pain and   involves the use of Xcode.</li> <li>The XCUITest driver does lots more than what can be done by WebDriverAgent, for example working   with simulators or devices, installing apps, and the like.</li> </ul> <p>The moral of the story is that driver architectures can become quite complicated and multilayered, due to the nature of the problem we're trying to solve. It also means it can be difficult sometimes to tell where in this chain of technologies something has gone wrong, if you run into a problem with a particular test. With the XCUITest world again, we have something like the following set of technologies all in play at the same time:</p> <ul> <li>Your test code (in its programming language) - owned by you</li> <li>The Appium client library - owned by Appium</li> <li>The Selenium client library - owned by Selenium</li> <li>The network (local or Internet)</li> <li>The Appium server - owned by Appium</li> <li>The Appium XCUITest driver - owned by Appium</li> <li>WebDriverAgent - owned by Appium</li> <li>Xcode - owned by Apple</li> <li>XCUITest - owned by Apple</li> <li>iOS itself - owned by Apple</li> <li>macOS (where Xcode and iOS simulators run) - owned by Apple</li> </ul> <p>It's a pretty deep stack!</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#proxy-mode","title":"Proxy mode","text":"<p>There's one other important architectural aspect of drivers to understand. It can be exemplified again by the XCUITest driver. Recall that we just discussed how the two \"halves\" of the XCUITest driver both speak the WebDriver protocol---the Node.js half clicks right into Appium's WebDriver server, and the Objective-c half (WebDriverAgent) is its own WebDriver implementation.</p> <p>This opens up the possibility of Appium taking a shortcut in certain cases. Let's imagine that the XCUITest driver needs to implement the <code>Click Element</code> command. The internal code of this implementation would look something like taking the appropriate parameters and constructing an HTTP request to the WebDriverAgent server. In this case, we're basically just reconstructing the client's original call to the Appium server!<sup>4</sup> So there's really no need to even write a function implementing the <code>Click Element</code> command. Instead, the XCUITest driver can just let Appium know that this command should be proxied directly to some other WebDriver server.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with the concept of \"proxying,\" in this case it just means that the XCUITest driver will not be involved at all in handling the command. Instead it will merely be repackaged and forwarded to WebDriverAgent at the protocol level, and WebDriverAgent's response will likewise be passed back directly to the client, without any XCUITest driver code seeing it or modifying it.</p> <p>This architectural pattern provides a nice bonus for driver authors who choose to deal with the WebDriver protocol everywhere, rather than constructing bespoke protocols. It also means that Appium can create wrapper drivers for any other existing WebDriver implementation very easily. If you look at the Appium Safari driver code, for example, you'll see that it implements basically no standard commands, because all of these are proxied directly to an underlying SafariDriver process.</p> <p>It's important to understand that this proxying business is sometimes happening under the hood, because if you're ever diving into some open source driver code trying to figure out where a command is implemented, you might be surprised to find no implementation at all in the Node.js driver code itself! In that case, you'll need to figure out where commands are being proxied to so you can look there for the appropriate implementation.</p> <p>OK, that's enough for this very detailed introduction to drivers!</p> <ol> <li> <p>You might notice that <code>setUrl</code> doesn't look anything like <code>Navigate To</code>, so how did we know to use it rather than some other random string? Well, Appium's WebDriver-protocol-to-method-name mapping is defined in a special file within the <code>@appium/base-driver</code> package called routes.js. So if you're writing a driver, this is where you would go to figure out what method names to use and what parameters to expect. Or you could look at the source for any of the main Appium drivers!\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Of course, we want to keep the semantics as similar as possible, but in the world of iOS, for example, launching an app via a deep link (a URL with a special app-specific scheme) is about as close as we are going to get to navigating to a web URL.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>You could in theory, therefore, point your WebDriver client straight to WebDriverAgent and bypass Appium entirely. This is usually not convenient, however, for a few reasons:\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>It's not exactly the same call, because the Appium server and the WebDriverAgent server will generate different session IDs, but these differences will be handled transparently.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"intro/history/","title":"Appium Project History","text":"<p>Appium has been around in one form or another since 2012.

The length of the test passes on the iOS product was getting out of hand. Less testing was an option, but would come with additional risk, especially with it taking several days to get patches through the iOS App Store Review process. He thought back to his days working on websites and realized automation was the answer.</p> <p>Dan surveyed the existing landscape of tools, only to find that all of them hand major drawbacks. The tool supplied by Apple, UIAutomation, required tests to be written in JavaScript, and did not allow for real-time debugging or interpretation. It also had to be executed inside the Xcode profiling tool, Instruments. Other 3rd-party tools used private APIs and required SDKs and HTTP Servers to be embedded into the application. This seemed highly undesirable.</p> <p>Unsatisfied with the existing options, Dan asked his manager for some additional time to see if he could find a better way. He spent 2 weeks poking and prodding around to see if there was a way to use approved Apple technologies to automate an iOS application. The first implementation he tried used AppleScript to send messages to Mac UI elements using the OS X accessibility APIs. This worked to some degree, but would never work on real devices, not to mention other drawbacks.</p> <p>So he thought, what if I could get the UIAutomation framework to run in real time like an interpreter? He looked into it and he determined that all he would need to do is find a way to receive, execute, and reply to commands from within a UIAutomation javascript program. Using the utility Apple provided for executing shell commands he was able to <code>cat</code> sequentially ordered text files to receive commands, <code>eval()</code> the output to execute them, and write them back to disk with <code>python</code>. He then prepared code in C# that implemented the Selenium-style syntax to write the sequentially ordered javascript commands. iOSAuto is born.</p>"},{"location":"intro/history/#selenium-conference-2012","title":"Selenium Conference 2012","text":"<p>Dan was selected to speak at Selenium Conference 2012 in London about an entirely different topic.

Several people suggested that he give a lightning talk later in the conference to explain exactly how it worked.</p> <p>On the second day of the conference, Dan stepped up on stage to give the lightning talk.  Jason Huggins, co-creator of Selenium, moderated the lightning talks.  Dan experienced technical difficulties getting his presentation to load, and Jason nearly had to move on to the next lightning talk.
