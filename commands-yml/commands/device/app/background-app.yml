name: Background App
short_description: Send the currently running app for this session to the background
description:
  >
    Send the currently active app to the background, and either return after a
    certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated.

    There are 3 types of parameters which may be passed to this method:


    1. An object that looks like `{"timeout": secs}`, where `secs` is an
       integer designating how long, in seconds, to background the app for. -1
       means to deactivate the app entirely.

    2. `null`, which means to deactivate the app entirely.

    3. _Deprecated_ An integer: how long, in seconds, to background the app for. -1 means to
       deactivate the app entirely.


    iOS tests with XCUITest can also use the `mobile: terminateApp` method to
    terminate the current app (see detailed [documentation](/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-xctest-mobile-apps-management.md#mobile-terminateapp)),
    and the `mobile: activateApp` to activate an existing application on the
    device under test and moves it to the foreground (see detailed [documentation](/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-xctest-mobile-apps-management.md#mobile-activateapp)).
