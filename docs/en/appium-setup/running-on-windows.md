#Windows Setup

Appium on Windows supports both Windows and Android app automation!

See [Windows App Testing](/docs/en/writing-running-appium/windows-app-testing.md) for more details.

## Running Appium on Windows

## Setup

To get started:

   1. Download latest [node and npm tools](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.3.0/node-v6.3.0-x64.msi) MSI (version >= 6.0). The `npm` and `nodejs` paths should be in your PATH environment variable. 
   2. Download latest Java JDK [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (accept the license agreement first). Set 'JAVA_HOME' to be your JDK path. The `bin` in that directory should be added to your PATH variable.
   3. Install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). Set `ANDROID_HOME` to be
   your Android SDK path and add the `tools` and `platform-tools` folders to your
   PATH variable.
   4. Install [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) or use the one that comes with the Android Windows SDK in the eclipse\plugins folder. Be sure to add the folder containing Ant to your PATH variable.
   5. Install [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and set the M2HOME and M2 environment variables. Set `M2_HOME` to the directory maven is installed in, and set `M2` to the `bin` in that directory. Add the path you used for `M2` to your PATH.
   6. Open admin cmd
   7. run command: npm install -g appium
   8. run command: appium
   9. Run a test from any Appium client (including Visual Studio)

## Additional Setup for Android App Testing

   1. To run tests on Windows, you will need to have the Android Emulator booted or an Android Device connected that is running an AVD with API Level 17 orgreater. Then run Appium on the command line (via the `appium` command)
   2. Within test script, change value of 'platformVersion' to correspond with emulator version (i.e. '4.4.4')
   3. Within test script, change value of 'app' to PATH('path of .apk') and ensure the entire path (including close parenthesis) is on one line

## Additional Setup for Windows App Testing

   1. To test a Windows app, make sure you have turned [developer mode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) on.

## Running Appium

See the [server documentation](/docs/en/writing-running-appium/server-args.md) for all the command line
arguments.

## Notes

- URL endpoint has to append "/wd/hub"
- DesiredCapabilities:
   - platformName = "Windows"
   - deviceName = "WindowsPC"

* On windows run appium.app as administrator or when running from source you need to run cmd as administrator.
* You must supply the `--no-reset` or `--full-reset` flags for
  Android to work on Windows.
* There exists a hardware accelerated emulator for Android, it has it's own
  limitations. For more information you can check out this
  [page](/docs/en/appium-setup/android-hax-emulator.md).
* Make sure that `hw.battery=yes` in your AVD's `config.ini`.
