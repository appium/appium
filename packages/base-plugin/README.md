# @appium/base-plugin

> Base class for creating other Appium plugins

This plugin should not be installed directly as it does nothing on its own. Instead, you should
extend this plugin when creating your *own* Appium plugins. Check out the
[Building Plugins](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/developing/build-plugins/) documentation
for more details.
