# GETTING STARTED
# -----------------
# This documentation is intended to show you how to get started with a
# simple Appium & Sauce Labs test.  This example is written with rspec and
# appium_lib, but you can use any Selenium client and test framework you like.
#
# This example expects SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY to be set in your
# environment.
#
# INSTALLING RVM
# --------------
# We're assuming you've got rvm installed, but if not, from a terminal
# run the following line (removing the ""'s):
#
# "\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby"
#
# INSTALLING GEMS
# ---------------
# Then, change to the example directory:
#   "cd appium-location/sample-code/examples/ruby"
#
# and install the required gems with bundler by doing:
#   "bundle install"
# 
# RUNNING TESTS
# -------------
# Run with:
#
# bundle exec rspec sauce_example.rb
require 'rspec'
require 'appium_lib'
require 'json'
require 'rest_client'

SAUCE_USERNAME = ENV['SAUCE_USERNAME']
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY = ENV['SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY']

# This is the test itself
describe 'Computation' do
  before(:each) do
    Appium::Driver.new(caps: desired_caps).start_driver
    Appium.promote_appium_methods RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup
  end

  after(:each) do
    # Get the success by checking for assertion exceptions,
    # and log them against the job, which is exposed by the session_id
    job_id = driver.send(:bridge).session_id
    update_job_success(job_id, example.exception.nil?)
    driver_quit
  end

  it 'should add two numbers' do
    values = [rand(10), rand(10)]
    expected_sum = values.reduce(&:+)

    textfields.each_with_index do |element, index|
      element.send_keys values[index]
    end

    # You can find buttons by text or, here, index
    button(1).click

    # You can find the first static text element
    first_text.text.should eq expected_sum.to_s
  end
end

      Your SAUCE_USERNAME or SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY environment variables 
      are empty or missing.
      
      You need to set these values to your Sauce Labs username and access
      key, respectively.
