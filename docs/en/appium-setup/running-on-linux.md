## Running Appium on Linux

### Limitations

If you are running Appium on Linux, you cannot use the prebuilt '.app',
which is built for OS X only. Additionally, you will not be able to test iOS
apps because Appium relies on OS X-only libraries to support iOS testing.

### Setup (Android)

Instructions for setting up Android and running tests on Linux are the same as
those on Mac OS X. See the [Android setup docs](/docs/en/appium-setup/android-setup.md).
