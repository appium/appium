We're therefore very excited to announce our first Development Partner: HeadSpin!</p> <p>HeadSpin is a real device performance and UX analysis cloud, with full support for Appium. When you run your Appium tests on HeadSpin, you get access to comprehensive performance reports about your app, including potential network, system resource, or user experience issues.

This program is now officially launching! Let's dive into some of the details.</p> <p>First of all, the details and fine print will always be available at Appium's Governance document, which outlines how the project is run, who makes project decisions, etc... This document will be kept up to date with the latest details of the program, so that's the place to bookmark for reference!</p> <p>As of now, Appium has opened up sponsorship opportunities via our OpenCollective page. OpenCollective is a service which allows people to donate to open source groups. We've defined a number of giving tiers for donations, within a very wide range, and welcome any financial amount with gratitude! Based on the donation tier, sponsorship comes with a variety of benefits, including recognition at different places in the Appium repo, docs, and website. In addition to financial sponsorship, the project has decided to recognize significant donations of project leadership and maintenance efforts from companies who have invested heavily into Appium with their employees' time (we call these \"Development Partners\").</p> <p>What will the project do with the funds raised through this sponsorship program? We aim to give it all back to the Appium community! With the details again available at our Governance document, we have implemented a scheme very much inspired by our friends at WebdriverIO (thanks WDIO friends!) There are three groups of contributors to Appium that this scheme supports: (1) project maintainers (those who devote consistent time to leading the project), (2) project contributors (anyone in the wider community that contributes code or documentation), and (3) upstream projects (other open source projects Appium relies heavily on to work well). Each month, the funds raised via sponsorship will be distributed in different amounts to each of these groups. So if you make a valuable contribution to Appium moving forward, you'll be eligible to get some cash as a thank-you! (You'll need to have your own OpenCollective account in good standing to receive funds).</p> <p>We're very excited about this new program, and hope that it helps existing and new contributors to feel even better about donating their time to making Appium better. And of course, none of this would be possible without the amazing Partners and Sponsors we hope to attract! On that note, stay tuned over the next few weeks as we unveil some of our initial program launch Partners! And if you or your company would like to participate by supporting Appium financially, you are most welcome. Just head over to our OpenCollective page and choose the tier that reflects your desired contribution level.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/03/07/hello-world/","title":"Hello World!","text":"<p>This is the first post in the Appium blog.

However, some more advanced features are toggled or configured via environment variables. To set environment variables, refer to the documentation for your operating system and terminal. These are the environment variables that the Appium server understands:</p> Variable\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Description <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> By default, Appium creates a directory called <code>.appium</code> in the home directory for your system user. You can adjust the directory with this variable, as detailed in the Managing Extensions guide. <code>APPIUM_TMP_DIR</code> By default, Appium uses a random temporary directory for many of its operations. If you wish to use a specific directory, you may do so by including an absolute path as the value of this variable. The behaviour is equivalent to using the <code>--tmp</code> CLI arg. <code>APPIUM_PREFER_SYSTEM_UNZIP</code> Set to <code>0</code> or <code>false</code> to request that Appium not use the <code>unzip</code> binary included on your system for unzipping downloaded apps or other artifacts. Instead it will use a JS-based unzip library. This could help on some systems with non-existent or non-standard <code>unzip</code> commands. Note that if unzipping fails using the system library, the fallback library will be attempted in any case, so setting this env var merely saves time in the event you know the system unzip will fail. <code>APPIUM_HOST</code> Same as the <code>--address</code> CLI arg <code>APPIUM_PORT</code> Same as the <code>--port</code> CLI arg <code>APPIUM_RELOAD_EXTENSIONS</code> Set to <code>1</code> to cause Appium to re-require extensions when new sessions are created. This is mostly useful for building extensions <code>APPIUM_OMIT_PEER_DEPS</code> Adds <code>--omit=peer</code> to all the NPM commands run internally by Appium. Mostly an internal feature. <code>APPIUM_APPS_CACHE_MAX_AGE</code> Allows to set the maximum age (in minutes) for cached applications. The default value is <code>60 * 24</code> (24 hours). Do not set it to a lower number than the duration of a single session startup. <code>APPIUM_APPS_CACHE_MAX_ITEMS</code> Allows to set the maximum amount of cached applications. The default value is <code>1024</code>. Do not set it to a lower number than the amount of apps in all parallel sessions per process. <code>APPIUM_APPS_CACHE_IGNORE_URL_QUERY</code> If the above option is enabled then the 'search' part of the app URL will be cut off from cache keys.

For example, the Appium UiAutomator2 driver interfaces with a special (Java-based) server running on the Android device. In webview mode, it also interfaces with Chromedriver.</p> <p>If you find yourself in this situation, it is extremely easy to tell Appium that your driver is just going to be proxying WebDriver commands straight to another endpoint.</p> <p>First, let Appium know that your driver can proxy by implementing the <code>canProxy</code> method:</p> <pre><code>canProxy() {\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, tell Appium which WebDriver routes it should not attempt to proxy (there often end up being certain routes that you don't want to forward on):</p> <pre><code>getProxyAvoidList() {\n    return [\n        ['POST', new RegExp('^/session/[^/]+/appium')]\n    ];\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The proxy avoidance list should be an array of arrays, where each inner array has an HTTP method as its first member, and a regular expression as its second. If the regular expression matches the route, then the route will not be proxied and instead will be handled by your driver. In this example, we are avoiding proxying all <code>POST</code> routes that have the <code>appium</code> prefix.</p> <p>Next, we have to set up the proxying itself. The way to do this is to use a special class from Appium called <code>JWProxy</code>. (The name means \"JSON Wire Proxy\" and is related to a legacy implementation of the protocol). You'll want to create a <code>JWProxy</code> object using the details required to connect to the remote server:</p> <pre><code>// import {JWProxy} from 'appium/driver';\n\nconst proxy = new JWProxy({\n    server: 'remote.server',\n    port: 1234,\n    base: '/',\n});\n\nthis.proxyReqRes = proxy.proxyReqRes.bind(proxy);\nthis.proxyCommand = proxy.command.bind(proxy);\n</code></pre> <p>Here we are creating a proxy object and assigning some of its methods to <code>this</code> under the names <code>proxyReqRes</code> and <code>proxyCommand</code>. This is required for Appium to use the proxy, so don't forget this step! The <code>JWProxy</code> has a variety of other options which you can check out in the source code, as well. (TODO: publish options as API docs and link here).</p> <p>Finally, we need a way to tell Appium when the proxy is active. For your driver it might always be active, or it might only be active when in a certain context. You can define the logic as an implementation of <code>proxyActive</code>:</p> <pre><code>proxyActive() {\n    return true; // or use custom logic\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With those pieces in play, you won't have to reimplement anything that's already implemented by the remote endpoint you're proxying to.

If you want to expose behaviours that don't map to any of the existing commands, you can create new commands in one of two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Extending the WebDriver protocol and creating client-side plugins to access the extensions</li> <li>Overloading the Execute Script command by defining Execute    Methods</li> </ol> <p>If you want to follow the first path, you can direct Appium to recognize new methods and add them to its set of allowed HTTP routes and command names. You do this by assigning the <code>newMethodMap</code> static variable in your driver class to an object of the same form as Appium's <code>routes.js</code> object. For example, here is the <code>newMethodMap</code> for the <code>FakeDriver</code> example driver:</p> <pre><code>static newMethodMap = {\n  '/session/:sessionId/fakedriver': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakeThing'},\n    POST: {command: 'setFakeThing', payloadParams: {required: ['thing']}},\n  },\n  '/session/:sessionId/fakedriverargs': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakeDriverArgs'},\n  },\n};\n</code></pre> <p>In this example we're adding a few new routes and a total of 3 new commands. For more examples of how to define commands in this way, it's best to have a look through <code>routes.js</code>. Now all you need to do is implement the command handlers in the same way you'd implement any other Appium command.</p> <p>The downside of this way of adding new commands is that people using the standard Appium clients won't have nice client-side functions designed to target these endpoints. So you would need to create and release client-side plugins for each language you want to support (directions or examples can be found at the relevant client docs).</p> <p>An alternative to this way of doing things is to overload a command which all WebDriver clients have access to already: Execute Script. Appium provides some a convenient tool for making this easy. Let's say you are building a driver for stereo system called <code>soundz</code>, and you wanted to create a command for playing a song by name. You could expose this to your users in such a way that they call something like:</p> <pre><code>// webdriverio example. Calling webdriverio's `executeScript` command is what trigger's Appium's\n// Execute Script command handler\ndriver.executeScript('soundz: playSong', [{song: 'Stairway to Heaven', artist: 'Led Zeppelin'}]);\n</code></pre> <p>Then in your driver code you can define the static property <code>executeMethodMap</code> as a mapping of script names to methods on your driver. It has the same basic form as <code>newMethodMap</code>, described above. Once <code>executeMethodMap</code> is defined, you'll also need to implement the Execute Script command handler, which according to Appium's routes mapping is called <code>execute</code>. The implementation can call a single helper function, <code>this.executeMethod</code>, which takes care of looking at the script and arguments the user sent in and routing it to the correct custom handler you've defined. Here's an example:</p> <pre><code>static executeMethodMap = {\n  'soundz: playSong', {\n    command: 'soundzPlaySong',\n    params: {required: ['song', 'artist'], optional: []},\n  }\n}\n\nasync soundzPlaySong(song, artist) {\n  // play the song based on song and artist details\n}\n\nasync execute(script, args) {\n  return await this.executeMethod(script, args);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A couple notes about this system: 1. The arguments array sent via the call to Execute Script must contain only zero or one element(s). The    first item in the list is considered to be the parameters object for your method. These parameters    will be parsed, validated, and then applied to your overload method in the order specified in    <code>executeMethodMap</code> (the order specified in the <code>required</code> parameters list, followed by the    <code>optional</code> parameters list). I.e., this framework assumes only a single actual argument sent in via    Execute Script (and this argument should be an object with keys/values representing the    parameters your execute method expects). 1. Appium does not automatically implement <code>execute</code> (the Execute Script handler) for you. You may    wish, for example, to only call the <code>executeMethod</code> helper function when you're not in proxy    mode! 1. The <code>executeMethod</code> helper will reject with an error if a script name doesn't match one of the    script names defined as a command in <code>executeMethodMap</code>, or if there are missing parameters.</p>"},{"location":"developing/build-drivers/#build-appium-doctor-checks","title":"Build Appium Doctor checks","text":"<p>Your users can run <code>appium driver doctor &lt;driverName&gt;</code> to run installation and health checks.

It could happen that a command which a plugin wants to handle is designated as a command which is being proxied to an upstream server. In this case, we run into a problem, because the plugin never gets a chance to handle that command! For this reason, plugins can implement a special member function called <code>shouldAvoidProxy</code>, which takes the following parameters:</p> <ol> <li><code>method</code> - string denoting HTTP method (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, etc...)</li> <li><code>route</code> - string denoting the requested resource, for example <code>/session/8b3d9aa8-a0ca-47b9-9ab7-446e818ec4fc/source</code></li> <li><code>body</code> - optional value of any type representing the WebDriver request body</li> </ol> <p>These parameters define an incoming request.

You do this by assigning the <code>newMethodMap</code> static variable in your driver class to an object of the same form as Appium's <code>routes.js</code> object. For example, here is part of the <code>newMethodMap</code> for the <code>FakePlugin</code> example driver:</p> <pre><code>static newMethodMap = {\n  '/session/:sessionId/fake_data': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakeSessionData', neverProxy: true},\n    POST: {\n      command: 'setFakeSessionData',\n      payloadParams: {required: ['data']},\n      neverProxy: true,\n    },\n  },\n  '/session/:sessionId/fakepluginargs': {\n    GET: {command: 'getFakePluginArgs', neverProxy: true},\n  },\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>If you're using TypeScript, static member objects like these should be defined <code>as const</code>.</p> <p>In this example we're adding a few new routes and a total of 3 new commands.

Setting <code>neverProxy</code> to <code>true</code> here will cause Appium to never proxy these routes and therefore ensure your plugin handles them, even if a driver is in proxy mode.</p> <p>The downside of adding new commands via <code>newMethodMap</code> is that people using the standard Appium clients won't have nice client-side functions designed to target these endpoints. So you would need to create and release client-side plugins for each language you want to support (directions or examples can be found at the relevant client docs).</p> <p>An alternative to this way of doing things is to overload a command which all WebDriver clients have access to already: Execute Script. Make sure to read the section on adding new commands in the Building Drivers guide to understand the way this works in general. The way it works with plugins is only slightly different. Let's look at an example taken from Appium's <code>fake-plugin</code>:</p> <pre><code>static executeMethodMap = {\n  'fake: plugMeIn': {\n    command: 'plugMeIn',\n    params: {required: ['socket']},\n  },\n};\n\nasync plugMeIn(next, driver, socket) {\n  return `Plugged in to ${socket}`;\n}\n\nasync execute(next, driver, script, args) {\n  return await this.executeMethod(next, driver, script, args);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We have three important components shown here which make this system work, all of which are defined inside the plugin class:</p> <ol> <li>The <code>executeMethodMap</code>, defined in just the same way as for drivers</li> <li>The implementation of the command method as defined in <code>executeMethodMap</code> (in this case,    <code>plugMeIn</code>)</li> <li>The overriding/handling of the <code>execute</code> command. Just like any plugin command handlers, the first two arguments are <code>next</code> and <code>driver</code>, followed by the script name and args. <code>BasePlugin</code> implements a helper method which we can simply call with all of these arguments.</li> </ol> <p>Overriding Execute Methods from drivers works as you'd expect: if your plugin defines an Execute Method with the same name as that of a driver, your command (in this case <code>plugMeIn</code>) will be called first.

The mapping itself is a <code>Map</code> with a unique identifier for the argument as the key, and an <code>ArgSpec</code> (<code>lib/schema/arg-spec.js</code>) object as the value.</p> <p>An <code>ArgSpec</code> object stores the following metadata:</p> Property Name Description <code>name</code> Canonical name of the argument, corresponding to the property name in the schema. <code>extType?</code> <code>driver</code> or <code>plugin</code>, if appropriate <code>extName?</code> Extension name, if appropriate <code>ref</code> Computed <code>$id</code> of the property in the schema <code>arg</code> Argument as accepted on CLI, without leading dashes <code>dest</code> Property name in parsed arguments object (as returned by <code>argparse</code>'s <code>parse_args()</code>) <code>defaultValue?</code> Value of the <code>default</code> keyword in schema, if appropriate <p>When a schema is finalized, the <code>Map</code> is populated with <code>ArgSpec</code> objects for all known arguments.</p> <p>So when the adapter is creating the pipeline of functions for the argument's <code>type</code>, it already has an <code>ArgSpec</code> for the argument. It creates a function which calls <code>validate(value, ref)</code> (in <code>lib/schema/schema.js</code>) where <code>value</code> is whatever the user provided, and <code>ref</code> is the <code>ref</code> property of the <code>ArgSpec</code>. The concept is that <code>ajv</code> can validate using any <code>ref</code> it knows about; each property in a schema can be referenced by this <code>ref</code> whether it's defined or not. To help visualize, if a schema is:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"$id\": \"my-schema.json\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>ref</code> of <code>foo</code> would be <code>my-schema.json#/properties/foo</code>. Assuming our <code>Ajv</code> instance knows about this <code>my-schema.json</code>, then we can call its <code>getSchema(ref)</code> method (which has a <code>schema</code> property, but is a misnomer nonetheless) to get a validation function; <code>validate(value, ref)</code> in <code>schema.js</code> calls this validation function.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The schema spec says a schema author can supply an explicit <code>$id</code> keyword to override this; it's unsupported by Appium at this time. If needed, extension authors must carefully use <code>$ref</code> without custom <code>$id</code>s. It's highly unlikely an extension would have a schema so complicated as to need this, however; Appium itself doesn't even use <code>$ref</code> to define its own properties!</p> <p>Next, let's take a look at how Appium loads schemas. This actually happens before any argument validation.</p>"},{"location":"developing/config-system/#schema-loading","title":"Schema Loading","text":"<p>Let's ignore extensions for a moment, and start with the base schema.</p> <p>When something first imports the <code>lib/schema/schema.js</code> module, an instance of an <code>AppiumSchema</code> is created. This is a singleton, and its methods are exported from the module (all of which are bound to the instance).</p> <p>The constructor does very little; it instantiates an <code>Ajv</code> instance and configures it with Appium's custom keywords and adds support for the <code>format</code> keyword via the ajv-formats module.</p> <p>Otherwise, the <code>AppiumSchema</code> instance does not interact with the <code>Ajv</code> instance until its <code>finalize()</code> method (exported as <code>finalizeSchema()</code>) is called. When this method is called, we're saying \"we are not going to add any more schemas; go ahead and create <code>ArgSpec</code> objects and register schemas with <code>ajv</code>\".</p> <p>When does finalization happen? Well:</p> <ol> <li>When the <code>appium</code> executable begins, it checks for and configures extensions (hand-wave) in <code>APPIUM_HOME</code>.</li> <li>Only then does it start to think about arguments--it instantiates an <code>ArgParser</code>, which (as you'll recall) runs the adapter to convert the schema to arguments.</li> <li>Finalization happens here--when creating the parser. Appium need the schema(s) to be registered with <code>ajv</code> in order to create validation functions for arguments.</li> <li>Thereafter, Appium parses the arguments with the <code>ArgParser</code>.</li> <li>Finally, decides what to do with the returned object.</li> </ol> <p>Without extensions, <code>finalize()</code> still knows about the Appium base schema (<code>appium-config-schema.js</code>), and just registers that. However, step 1. above is doing a lot of work, so let's look at how extensions come into play.</p>"},{"location":"developing/config-system/#extension-support","title":"Extension Support","text":"<p>One of the design goals of this system is the following:</p> <p>An extension should be able to register custom CLI arguments with the Appium, and a user should be able to use them like any other argument.</p> <p>Previously, Appium 2 accepted arguments in this manner (via <code>--driverArgs</code>), but validation was hand-rolled and required extension implementors to use a custom API. It also required the user to awkwardly pass a JSON string as the configuration on the command-line. Further, no contextual help (via <code>--help</code>) existed for these arguments.</p> <p>Now, by providing a schema for its options, a driver or plugin can register CLI arguments and config file schemas with Appium.</p> <p>To register a schema, an extension must provide the <code>appium.schema</code> property in its <code>package.json</code>. The value may be a schema or a path to a schema. If the latter, the schema should be JSON or a CommonJS module (ESM not supported at this time, nor is YAML).</p> <p>For any property in this schema, the property will appear as a CLI argument of the form <code>--&lt;extension-type&gt;-&lt;extension-name&gt;-&lt;property-name&gt;</code>. For example, if the <code>fake</code> driver provides a property <code>foo</code>, the argument will be <code>--driver-fake-foo</code>, and will show in <code>appium server --help</code> like any other CLI argument.</p> <p>The corresponding property in a config file would be <code>server.&lt;extension-type&gt;.&lt;extension-name&gt;.&lt;property-name&gt;</code>, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"server\": {\n    \"driver\": {\n      \"fake\": {\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The naming convention described above avoids problems of one extension type having a name conflict with a different extension type.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>While an extension can provide aliases via <code>appiumCliAliases</code>, \"short\" flags are disallowed, since all arguments from extensions are prefixed with <code>--&lt;extension-type&gt;-&lt;extension-name&gt;-</code>. The extension name and argument name will be kebab-cased for the CLI, according to Lodash's rules around kebab-casing.</p> <p>The schema object will look much like Appium's base schema, but it will only have top-level properties (nested properties are currently unsupported). Example:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"title\": \"my rad schema for the cowabunga driver\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"fizz\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"buzz\",\n      \"$comment\": \"corresponds to CLI --driver-cowabunga-fizz\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As written in a user's config file, this would be the <code>server.driver.cowabunga.fizz</code> property.</p> <p>When extensions are loaded, the <code>schema</code> property is verified and the schema is registered with the <code>AppiumSchema</code> (it is not registered with <code>Ajv</code> until <code>finalize()</code> is called).</p> <p>During finalization, each registered schema is added to the <code>Ajv</code> instance. The schema is assigned an <code>$id</code> based on the extension type and name (which overrides whatever the extension provides, if anything). Schemas are also forced to disallowed unknown arguments via the <code>additionalProperties: false</code> keyword.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the base schema has <code>driver</code> and <code>plugin</code> properties which are objects. When finalized, a property is added to each--corresponding to an extension name--and the value of this property is a reference to the <code>$id</code> of a property in the extension schema. For example, the <code>server.driver</code> property will look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"driver\": {\n    \"cowabunga\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"driver-cowabunga.json\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is why we call it the \"base\" schema--it is mutated when extensions provide schemas. The extension schemas are kept separately, but the references are added to the schema before it's ultimately added to <code>ajv</code>. This works because an <code>Ajv</code> instance understands references from any schema it knows about to any schema it knows about.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This makes it impossible to provide a complete static schema for Appium and the installed extensions (as of Nov 5 2021). A static <code>.json</code> schema is generated from the base (via a Gulp task), but it does not contain any extension schemas. The static schema also has uses beyond Appium; e.g., IDEs can provide contextual error-checking of config files this way. Let's solve this?</p> <p>Just like how we look up the reference ID of a particular argument in the base schema, validation of arguments from extensions happens the exact same way. If the <code>cowabunga</code> driver has the schema ID <code>driver-cowabunga.json</code>, then the <code>fizz</code> property can be referenced from any schema registered with <code>ajv</code> via <code>driver-cowabunga.json#/properties/fizz</code>. \"Base\" schema arguments begin with <code>appium.json#properties/</code> instead.</p>"},{"location":"developing/config-system/#development-environment-support","title":"Development Environment Support","text":"<p>During the flow of development, a couple extra tasks have been automated to maintain the base schema:</p> <ul> <li>As a post-transpilation step, a <code>lib/appium-config.schema.json</code> gets generated from</li> <li><code>lib/schema/appium-config-schema.js</code> (in addition to its CJS counterpart generated by Babel).</li> <li>This file is under version control.

Depending on which client you are using, the prefix may be added automatically or in conjunction with certain interfaces, but it is always a good practice to explicitly include it for clarity.</p> <p>Here is a list of all the globally-recognized Appium capabilities:</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Individual drivers and plugins can support other capabilities, so refer to their documentation for lists ofspecific capability names. Some drivers may also not support all of these capabilities</p> Capability Type Required? Description <code>platformName</code> <code>string</code> yes The type of platform hosting the app or browser <code>appium:automationName</code> <code>string</code> yes The name of the Appium driver to use <code>browserName</code> <code>string</code> no The name of the browser to launch and automate, if the driver supports web browsers as a special case <code>appium:app</code> <code>string</code> no The path to an installable application <code>appium:deviceName</code> <code>string</code> no The name of a particular device to automate, e.g., <code>iPhone 14</code> (currently only actually useful for specifying iOS simulators, since in other situations it's typically recommended to use a specific device id via the <code>appium:udid</code> capability). <code>appium:platformVersion</code> <code>string</code> no The version of a platform, e.g., for iOS, <code>16.0</code> <code>appium:newCommandTimeout</code> <code>number</code> no The number of seconds the Appium server should wait for clients to send commands before deciding that the client has gone away and the session should shut down <code>appium:noReset</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, instruct an Appium driver to avoid its usual reset logic during session start and cleanup (default <code>false</code>) <code>appium:fullReset</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, instruct an Appium driver to augment its usual reset logic with additional steps to ensure maximum environmental reproducibility (default <code>false</code>) <code>appium:eventTimings</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, instruct an Appium driver to collect Event Timings (default <code>false</code>) <code>appium:printPageSourceOnFindFailure</code> <code>boolean</code> no If true, collect the page source and print it to the Appium log whenever a request to find an element fails (default <code>false</code>) <p>Some drivers place more complex constraints on capabilities as a group. For example, while the <code>appium:app</code> and <code>browserName</code> capabilities are listed above as optional, if you want to launch a session with a specific app, the XCUITest driver requires that at least one of <code>appium:app</code>, <code>browserName</code>, or <code>appium:bundleId</code> are included in the capabilities (otherwise it will not know what app to install and/or launch and will simply open a session on the home screen). Each driver will document how it interprets these capabilities and any other platform-specific requirements.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Capabilities are like parameters used when starting a session. After the capabilities are sent and the session is started, they cannot be changed. If a driver supports updating aspects of its behaviour in the course of a session, it will provide a Setting for this purpose instead of, or in addition to, a capability.</p> <p>Each Appium client has its own way of constructing capabilities and starting a session.

However, the additional complexity of mixing \"modes\" within a single application can make it difficult for automation tools that are designed to target the \"native\" elements and behaviours.</p> <p>Appium provides a set of APIs for working with different app modes, called \"contexts\", that Appium drivers can implement if they support automation commands in these different modes. There are three basic commands that Appium has added to the W3C WebDriver spec for this purpose:</p> Command Name Method/Route Params Description Returns <code>Get Contexts</code> <code>GET /session/:id/contexts</code> Get a list of the available contexts <code>array&lt;string&gt;</code> <code>Get Current Context</code> <code>GET /session/:id/context</code> Get the name of the active context <code>string</code> <code>Set Context</code> <code>POST /session/:id/context</code> <code>name</code> (<code>string</code>) Switch into the context with the given <code>name</code> <code>null</code> <p>This API is flexible enough to handle a variety of semantic interpretations on the part of the driver. For example, the XCUITest driver includes two kinds of contexts: the native app context and any active webviews, as one context per webview. A call to <code>Get Contexts</code> will return the list of names, which you as a test author can sift through and use to switch into the appropriate context. As another example, the Appium Altunity Plugin introduces the concept of a <code>UNITY</code> context, which encapsulates all the plugin's specific behaviour to ensure that when outside of the <code>UNITY</code> context, the active driver's usual command implementations are used.</p> <p>It is important to note that a call to <code>Get Contexts</code> will always contain at least one context, conventionally but not necessarily named <code>NATIVE_APP</code>. This is the default active context.</p> <p>Depending on the type of context you're in, the operation of the driver might change. The XCUITest driver, when targeting a webview context, will not run its typical routines for finding and interacting with elements. Instead, it will run a different set of routines appropriate to web elements. This might have a variety of consequences, like supporting a different set of locator strategies.</p> <p>The command names in the table above are generic references to the commands and not code examples.

There are two main strategies for this:</p> <ol> <li>Appium drivers define new W3C-compatible API routes, and Appium clients are updated to include    support for those new routes.</li> <li>Appium drivers define so-called \"Execute Methods\" which provide new functionality by    overloading the existing <code>Execute Script</code> command which is already available in any WebDriver-    based client library (including all Selenium and Appium clients).</li> </ol> <p>There are pros and cons for each strategy, but it is ultimately up to the extension author to decide how they wish implement new commands. </p> <p>This guide is designed to specifically help you understand the \"Execute Method\" strategy.  This pattern is commonly used in official Appium drivers and other third-party extensions. Here's an example of how the <code>Execute Script</code> command is designed to work in the world of WebDriver and browser automation:</p> JS (WebDriverIO)JavaPythonRubyC# <pre><code>await driver.executeScript('return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', [3, 4])\n</code></pre> <pre><code>JavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njsDriver.executeScript(\"return arguments[0] + arguments[1]\", 3, 4);\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script('return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', 3, 4)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script 'return arguments[0] + arguments[1]', 3, 4\n</code></pre> <pre><code>((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(\"return arguments[0] + arguments[1]\", 3, 4);\n</code></pre> <p>What's happening here is that we are defining a snippet of Javascript (technically, a function body) to be executed within the web browser. The client can send arguments which are serialized, sent over HTTP, and finally provided to the function as parameters.  In this example, we are essentially defining an addition function. The return value of the <code>Execute Script</code> command is whatever the return value of the Javascript snippet is! In the case of this example, that value would be the number <code>7</code> (<code>3</code> + <code>4</code>).</p> <p>Each client library has its own way of calling the command and providing any arguments to the script function, but the function itself\u2014the snippet\u2014is always a string and is the same across all languages.</p> <p>In the world of Appium, we are usually not automating a web browser, which means this command is not particularly useful. But it is useful as a way to encode the name of an arbitrary command and to provide parameters. For example, the XCUITest Driver has implemented a command that lets a client terminate a running application if you know the ID (the <code>bundleId</code>) of the app. The way that the driver makes this command available is via the Execute Method <code>mobile: terminateApp</code>. Instead of providing a JavaScript function to the \"Execute Script\" command, the user provides a known string as defined by the driver. The only other thing a client needs to know is the set of parameters for the method, which are documented by the driver. In this case, we have a parameter named <code>bundleId</code>, whose value should be a string encoding the ID of the app to terminate. Here is how this Execute Method would be called:</p> JS (WebDriverIO)JavaPythonRubyC# <pre><code>await driver.executeScript('mobile: terminateApp', [{bundleId: 'com.my.app'}])\n</code></pre> <pre><code>JavascriptExecutor jsDriver = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njsDriver.executeScript(\"mobile: terminateApp\", ImmutableMap.of(\"bundleId\", \"com.my.app\"));\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script('mobile: terminateApp', {'bundleId': 'com.my.app'})\n</code></pre> <pre><code>driver.execute_script 'mobile: terminateApp', { bundleId: 'com.my.app' }\n</code></pre> <pre><code>((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(\"mobile: terminateApp\",\n    new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { \"bundleId\", \"com.my.app\" } });\n</code></pre> <p>There are two important differences in using Appium Execute Methods from vanilla Selenium Javascript execution:</p> <ol> <li>The script string is just a command name; it will be provided by the driver documentation</li> <li>The standard way to provide parameters is as a single object with keys representing parameter    names and values representing parameter values. So in this case, we had to specify both the    parameter name (<code>bundleId</code>) as the key of the parameters object, and the parameter value    (<code>com.my.app</code>) as the value for that key. A driver can define parameters as required or optional.</li> </ol> <p>Of course, always refer to the documentation for the particular Execute Method in case the author has made any alterations to the standard access method.</p>"},{"location":"guides/grid/","title":"Appium and Selenium Grid","text":""},{"location":"guides/grid/#using-selenium-grid-4","title":"Using Selenium Grid 4+","text":"<p>The relay feature in Grid 4 allows you to proxy Appium requests to an Appium server instance.

The Extension CLI comes with a variety of commands and parameters; see the documentation for that command for all the specifics.</p> <p>The all-important question when Appium is managing your extensions for you is: where are they installed? Appium manages extensions in a directory specified by the <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> environment variable. You can set that variable to anything you like, and Appium will manage its extensions there. You can therefore also use the <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> environment variable to manage different sets of extensions, for example if you want to have the same driver installed at conflicting versions:</p> <pre><code>APPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home1 appium driver install xcuitest@4.11.1\nAPPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home2 appium driver install xcuitest@4.11.2\n</code></pre> <p>Running these commands will result in two separate <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> directories being created and populated with the corresponding version of the XCUITest driver. You can then use the same environment variables to direct Appium which version to use on launch:</p> <pre><code>APPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home1 appium  # use xcuitest driver 4.11.1\nAPPIUM_HOME=/path/to/home2 appium  # use xcuitest driver 4.11.2\n</code></pre> <p>You don't need to set <code>APPIUM_HOME</code> if you don't want to!

If you're using an updated Appium client (at least one maintained by the Appium team), the client will add the <code>appium:</code> prefix for you on all necessary capabilities automatically.

So let's dive in.</p>"},{"location":"intro/appium/#appiums-choice-of-api","title":"Appium's choice of API","text":"<p>Appium is very fortunate to have been preceded by a technology which has been a long-standing pioneer in the field of UI automation, namely Selenium. The goal of the Selenium project has been to support UI automation of web browsers, and in this way we can think of it as occupying a subset of Appium's goals. Along the way, Selenium (and, after they merged, another project called WebDriver) developed a relatively stable API for browser automation.</p> <p>Over the years, Selenium worked with various web browser vendors and the W3C standards group to turn its API into an official web browser standard, called the WebDriver specification. All the main browsers now implement automation capabilities inline with the WebDriver spec, without the Selenium team having to maintain any software that performs actual automation; standards for the win!</p> <p>Appium's initial goals were to develop an automation standard for mobile apps (iOS and Android). We could have made up something new, but in the spirit of joining forces and keeping standards, well, standard, we decided to adopt the WebDriver spec as Appium's API.<sup>2</sup> While user interaction on websites and in mobile native apps are not entirely identical (with even greater differences once we start to consider, for example, TV platforms controlled by simple remotes), the fact is that most software UIs are pretty much the same. This means that the WebDriver spec provides automation API primitives (finding elements, interacting with elements, loading pages or screens, etc...) that more or less map to any platform.</p> <p>Of course, Appium wants to support the cases where user interaction does differ from web to mobile or web to TV, and so Appium also makes use of the built-in extensibility of the WebDriver spec. The result is that, no matter what platform you want to automate, when you use Appium, you will do so using the standard WebDriver spec, with two caveats:</p> <ul> <li>We might not have any way to support a particular WebDriver API command on a given platform, and   so some commands might be unsupported (for example, getting or setting cookies is not possible in   the world of native mobile app automation).</li> <li>We might support automation behaviours that go beyond what's available in the WebDriver API   command list, though any such commands will be valid and spec-compliant extensions to the   WebDriver API.</li> </ul> <p>How do you actually use the WebDriver API, particularly in the context of Appium? We'll cover that in the section below on how Appium provides universal programming language access. All you need to know for now is that the way Appium introduces a universal UI automation interface is by implementing the WebDriver protocol.</p>"},{"location":"intro/appium/#platform-automation-behaviour","title":"Platform automation behaviour","text":"<p>The next question is, how does Appium map this protocol to automation behaviour on a wide range of platforms? The trick is that, strictly speaking, Appium doesn't! It leaves this responsibility up to a kind of software module called an Appium driver. There's a whole Driver Introduction which you can read next, so we won't go into huge detail on how they work for now.</p> <p>What's important to understand at the moment is that a driver is kind of like a pluggable module for Appium that gives Appium the power to automate a particular platform (or set of platforms, depending on the goal of the driver). At the end of the day, a driver's responsibility is to simply implement an Appium-internal interface representing the WebDriver protocol. How it implements this interface is totally up to the driver, based on its strategy for making automation happen on a specific platform. Typically, and with a lot more complexity and difficulty in the details, a driver does this by relying on platform-specific automation technologies. For example, Apple maintains an iOS automation technology called XCUITest. The Appium driver that supports iOS app automation is called the XCUITest Driver because ultimately what it does is convert the WebDriver protocol to XCUITest library calls.</p> <p>One of the reasons that drivers are independent, pluggable modules is that they work completely differently from one another. The tools and requirements for building and using drivers for different platforms are completely different. And so Appium lets you use just the drivers that you need for your automation tasks. Choosing drivers and installing them so that you can use them with your Appium instance is so important that Appium has its very own CLI for managing drivers.</p> <p>So, to answer our original question, the way that Appium provides access to automation capabilities for a given platform is that the Appium team (or anyone else<sup>3</sup>) writes a driver for that platform, implementing as much or little of the WebDriver protocol as desired. The driver can then be installed by anyone using Appium.</p>"},{"location":"intro/appium/#universal-programming-language-access","title":"Universal programming language access","text":"<p>But what does it mean, or look like, to use Appium, anyway? Since Appium is ultimately a Node.js program, it could have looked like importing Appium and its drivers as libraries into your own Node.js programs. But that wouldn't meet Appium's goal of providing automation capabilities to people using any popular programming language.</p> <p>Luckily, the fact that Appium rode in on Selenium's coattails meant that we had a solution to this problem from day one. You see, the WebDriver specification is actually an HTTP-based protocol, meaning it is designed to be used over a network rather than within the memory of a single program.</p> <p>One of the main benefits of this \"client-server\" architecture is that it allows the automation implementer (the thing doing the automation, in this case the 'server') to be completely distinct from the automation runner (the thing defining what automation should be done, in what steps, etc..., in this case the 'client'). Basically, all the \"hard stuff\" (actually figuring out how to make automation happen on a given platform) can be handled in one place by the server, and \"thin\" client libraries can be written in any programming language which simply encode HTTP requests to the server in language-appropriate way. It's possible, in other words, to bring basic Appium / WebDriver capabilities to a new programming language relatively easily, assuming high-level HTTP libraries exist, simply by coding up a basic HTTP client in that language.</p> <p>There are a couple important takeaways here for you, the Appium user:</p> <ul> <li>Appium is an HTTP server. It must run as a process on some computer for as long as you want to   be able to use it for automation. It must be accessible on the network to whichever computer you   want to use to run the automation from (whether that is the same machine or one across the   world).</li> <li>Unless you want to write raw HTTP calls or use cURL, using Appium for automation involves the use   of an Appium Client in the language of your choice. The goal of each of these   clients is to encapsulate the WebDriver protocol so that rather than worrying about the protocol   itself, you can work with objects and methods that feel idiomatic for your language.</li> <li>The Appium server and the Appium client do not need to be running on the same computer. You   simply need to be able to send HTTP requests from the client to the server over some network.   This greatly facilitates the use of cloud providers for Appium, since they can host the Appium   server and any related drivers and devices, and all you need to do is point your client script to   their secure endpoints.</li> </ul> <p>And of course, none of this is about \"testing\" per se, purely about the use of Appium and its client libraries for automation purposes. If you want to do automation for the purpose of \"testing\", you'll likely want to enlist the help of test runners, test frameworks, and the like, none of which need be related to Appium; one of the benefits of Appium's \"universal accessibility\" is that it plays well with whatever set of tools you find most beneficial for your situation.</p>"},{"location":"intro/appium/#appiums-huge-scope","title":"Appium's huge scope","text":"<p>Appium's vision (automation of everything under a single API) is huge! Certainly, much bigger than the team of core maintainers for the open source project. So how does Appium hope to achieve this goal? Basically, by empowering the community to develop functionality on top of Appium as a platform. This is what we call the Appium \"ecosystem\".</p> <p>The Appium team does officially maintain a few drivers itself (for example, the XCUITest driver that we spoke about earlier). But it cannot hope to have the platform-specific expertise or the capacity to maintain drivers for many different platforms. But what we have done, particularly beginning with Appium 2, is to provide tools to empower the community to join in our vision:</p> <ul> <li>Anyone can create a driver simply by creating a Node.js module that conforms to the appropriate   conventions and implements any (sub|super)set of the WebDriver protocol. Creating a driver often   involves a minimal amount of code because the WebDriver protocol details are abstracted away, and   many helper libraries are available---the same libraries that power the Appium team's own   drivers.</li> <li>Sharing drivers with others is easy using the Appium driver CLI. There is no central authority.   Anyone can share drivers publicly or privately, for free or for sale. Drivers can be open or   closed source (though obviously we appreciate open source!).</li> </ul> <p>Appium's vision of being a platform for development extends beyond the support of automation for all app platforms. As a popular automation tool, there are many opportunities for integrating Appium with all kinds of other tools and services. In addition, there are many feature ideas for Appium, either as a core server or in its incarnation across various drivers, which the core team will never have time to build. And so, with Appium 2, Appium has released a plugin system that enables anyone to build and share modules that change how Appium works!</p> <p>In the same way that drivers are easily shareable and consumable via the Appium driver CLI, plugins can be published and consumed via a parallel Plugin CLI. Plugins can do all sorts of things, for example adding the ability for Appium to find and interact with screen regions based on a template image (as in the <code>images</code> plugin). There are very few limitations on what you can do with plugins, so you might also be interested in learning how to Build Plugins in Node.js that can be used with Appium.</p> <p>So that's Appium: an extensible, universal interface for the UI automation of potentially everything!

Since then, Appium continued to evolve along with   the W3C spec and is fully W3C-compliant.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>You can build and share your own drivers!

This means that Appium implements a client-server architecture. The server (consisting of Appium itself along with any drivers or plugins you are using for automation) is connected to the devices under test, and is actually responsible for making automation happen on those devices. The client (driven by you, the Appium test author) is responsible for sending commands to the server over the network, and receiving responses from the server as a result. These responses can be used to tell whether automation commands are successful, or might contain information that you queried about the state of the application. This document is a conceptual introduction to the client side of this equation.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>For more about the server side of the equation (i.e., how does Appium actually control devices?), check out our Intro to Appium Drivers. To skip to a list of links to Appium client libraries, check out the list of clients.</p> <p>What sorts of automation commands are available? That is up to the particular driver and plugins that you are using in any given session. A standard set of commands would include, for example, the following:</p> <ul> <li>Find Element</li> <li>Click Element</li> <li>Get Page Source</li> <li>Take Screenshot</li> </ul> <p>If you look at these commands in the WebDriver specification, you'll notice that they are not defined in terms of any particular programming language. They are not Java commands, or JavaScript commands, or Python commands. Instead, they form part of an HTTP API which can be accessed from within any programming language (or none! you could just use cURL if you want).</p> <p>So, for example, the <code>Find Element</code> command corresponds to an HTTP <code>POST</code> request sent to the HTTP endpoint <code>/session/:sessionid/element</code> (where in this case, <code>:sessionid</code> is a placeholder for the unique session ID generated by the server in a previous call to <code>Create Session</code>).</p> <p>This information is primarily useful for people developing technology that works with the WebDriver spec. It's not particularly useful for people trying to write Appium or Selenium tests. When you write an Appium test, you want to use a programming language you're familiar with. Luckily, there exist a set of Appium client libraries<sup>1</sup> that take care of the responsibility of speaking HTTP to the Appium server. Instead, they expose a set of \"native\" commands for a particular programming language, so that, to the test author, it just feels like you're writing Python, or JavaScript, or Java.</p> <p>As an example, here's the same simple set of Appium commands in five different programming languages, using the recommended Appium client binding for each language (note that this is not working sample code including all appropriate imports; see each client library's instructions for setup and command reference):</p> JavaScript (Webdriver.io)JavaPythonRubyC# <pre><code>const element = await driver.$('//*[@text=\"Foo\"]');\nawait element.click();\nconsole.log(await element.getText())\nconsole.log(await driver.getPageSource())\n</code></pre> <pre><code>WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.Xpath(\"//*[@text='Foo']\"))\nelement.click()\nSystem.out.println(element.getText())\nSystem.out.println(driver.getPageSource())\n</code></pre> <pre><code>element = driver.find_element(by=By.XPATH, value='//*[@text=\"Foo\"]')\nelement.click()\nprint(element.text)\nprint(driver.page_source)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>element = driver.find_element :xpath, '//*[@text=\"Foo\"]'\nelement.click\nputs element.text\nputs driver.page_source\n</code></pre> <pre><code>AppiumElement element = driver.FindElement(MobileBy.AccessibilityId(\"Views\"));   \nelement.click();\nSystem.Console.WriteLine(element.Text);\nSystem.Console.WriteLine(driver.PageSource);\n</code></pre> <p>Each of these scripts, despite being in different languages, does the same thing under the hood:</p> <ol> <li>Call <code>Find Element</code> with a <code>using</code> parameter of <code>xpath</code> and a <code>value</code> parameter expressing the    XPath query used to find an element. (If you're confused about these terms, you might find an    introduction to Appium or Selenium useful)</li> <li>Call <code>Click Element</code> with the ID of the element found in the previous call.</li> <li>Call <code>Get Element Text</code> with the ID of the same element, and print it to the console.</li> <li>Call <code>Get Page Source</code> to retrieve the page/app source and print it to the console.</li> </ol> <p>The only other thing to keep in mind before choosing or using a client is that each client is independently maintained. Just because a feature is available in one client, it doesn't mean it's available in another client (though all clients support at least the standard W3C protocol plus any common appium extensions). Just because one client has a nice set of helper functions, doesn't mean another will. Some clients are kept very frequently up to date, and others are not! So when thinking about choosing a library, the first consideration is the language you want to use, and the second consideration is how full-featured and well-maintained the library is!</p> <p>To learn how to use an Appium client, visit that client's homepage to learn more. In many cases, the Appium client for a given language is built on top of the Selenium client for that language, and so certain Appium clients may only document the features which the Appium client added on top of the Selenium client. All that to say, for a full reference, you may need to visit both the Appium client documentation as well as the Selenium client documentation.</p> <p>That's all you need to know about Appium clients! Head over to the Clients page to check out the current list of clients.</p> <ol> <li> <p>These libraries are alternately called \"clients\", \"client libraries\", or \"client bindings\".   They all mean the same thing!\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/","title":"Intro to Appium Drivers","text":"<p>As the main Overview makes clear, \"drivers\" are basically Appium's answer to the question, \"how do we support automation of multiple, unrelated platforms?\" In this doc we'll get into a little more detail about how drivers work. The specific details of how drivers work probably don't matter too much for you, unless you're planning on writing your own driver or contributing to an existing driver (things we hope you do!).</p> <p>The main benefit in understanding a bit more of how drivers work is that being aware of the typical complexity or the typical driver architecture will inform your debugging process when you inevitably run into an issue in one of your tests.</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#interface-implementations","title":"Interface Implementations","text":"<p>At the most basic level, drivers are simply Node.js classes that extend a special class included in Appium, called <code>BaseDriver</code>. You could have something very close to a \"working\" driver, with these very simple lines of code:</p> <pre><code>import BaseDriver from '@appium/base-driver'\n\nclass MyNewDriver extends BaseDriver {\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This empty driver doesn't do anything, but you could wrap it up in a Node.js module, add a few Appium-related fields to the module's manifest (<code>package.json</code>), and then install it using <code>appium driver install</code>.</p> <p>So, from a technical perspective, an Appium driver is just a bit of code that inherits from some other Appium code. That's it! Now, inheriting from <code>BaseDriver</code> actually gives us a lot, because <code>BaseDriver</code> is essentially an encapsulation of the entire WebDriver protocol. So all a driver needs to do something useful is to implement Node.js methods with names corresponding to their WebDriver protocol equivalents.</p> <p>So let's say I wanted to do something with this empty driver; first I have to decide which WebDriver command I want to implement. For our example, let's take the Navigate To WebDriver command. Leave aside for the moment what I want to have the driver do when this command is executed. To tell Appium the driver can handle the command, all we have to do is define a method like this in our driver class:<sup>1</sup></p> <pre><code>async setUrl(url) {\n    // do whatever we want here\n}\n</code></pre> <p>That's it! How we actually implement the command is totally up to us, and depends on the platform(s) we want to support. Here are some different example implementations of this command for different platforms:</p> <ul> <li>Browsers: execute some JavaScript to set <code>window.location.href</code></li> <li>iOS apps: launch an app using a deep link</li> <li>Android apps: launch an app using a deep link</li> <li>React apps: load a specific route</li> <li>Unity: go to a named scene</li> </ul> <p>So you can see there can be a lot of differences between how drivers implement the same WebDriver command across platforms.<sup>2</sup> What is the same, though, is how they express that they can handle a protocol command.</p> <p>We're going into this great amount of detail (which you don't need to remember, by the way), because it's important to stress the point that an Appium driver is not inherently anything in particular, other than a bit of JS code that can handle WebDriver protocol commands. Where you go from there is up to you, the driver author!</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#automation-mapping","title":"Automation mapping","text":"<p>But typically what driver authors want to do is to provide automation behaviours for a given platform(s) that are semantically very similar to the the WebDriver spec implementations for browsers. When you want to find an element, you should get a reference to a UI element. When you want to click or tap that element, the resulting behaviour should be the same as if a person were to click or tap on the element. And so on.</p> <p>So the real challenge for driver authors is not how to work with the WebDriver protocol (because <code>BaseDriver</code> encapsulates all that for you), but how to make the actual automation happen on the target platform. Every driver relies on its own set of underlying technologies here. As mentioned in the Overview, the iOS driver uses an Apple technology called XCUITest. These underlying automation technologies usually have proprietary or idiosyncratic APIs of their own. Writing a driver becomes the task of mapping the WebDriver protocol to this underlying API (or sometimes a set of different underlying APIs--for example, the UiAutomator2 driver relies not only on the UiAutomator2 technology from Google, but also functions only available through ADB, as well as functions only available via the Android SDK inside a helper app). Tying it all together into a single, usable, WebDriver interface is the incredibly useful (but incredibly challenging) art of driver development!</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#multi-level-architecture","title":"Multi-level architecture","text":"<p>In practice, this often results in a pretty complex architecture. Let's take iOS for example again. The XCUITest framework (the one used by the Appium driver) expects code that calls it to be written in Objective-C or Swift. Furthermore, XCUITest code can only be run in a special mode triggered by Xcode (and directly or indirectly, the Xcode command line tools). In other words, there's no straightforward way to go from a Node.js function implementation (like <code>setUrl()</code> above) to XCUITest API calls.</p> <p>What the XCUITest driver authors have done is instead to split the driver into two parts: one part written in Node.js (the part which is incorporated into Appium and which initially handles the WebDriver commands), and the other part written in Objective-C (the part which actually gets run on an iOS device and makes XCUITest API calls). This makes interfacing with XCUITest possible, but introduces the new problem of coordination between the two parts.</p> <p>The driver authors could have chosen any of a number of very different strategies to model the communication between the Node.js side and the Objective-C side, but at the end of the day decided to use ... the WebDriver protocol! That's right, the Objective-C side of the XCUITest driver is itself a WebDriver implementation, called WebDriverAgent.<sup>3</sup></p> <ul> <li>The Appium XCUITest driver builds and manages WebDriverAgent for you, which can be a pain and     involves the use of Xcode.</li> <li>The XCUITest driver does lots more than what can be done by WebDriverAgent, for example working     with simulators or devices, installing apps, and the like.</li> </ul> <p>The moral of the story is that driver architectures can become quite complicated and multilayered, due to the nature of the problem we're trying to solve. It also means it can be difficult sometimes to tell where in this chain of technologies something has gone wrong, if you run into a problem with a particular test. With the XCUITest world again, we have something like the following set of technologies all in play at the same time:</p> <ul> <li>Your test code (in its programming language) - owned by you</li> <li>The Appium client library - owned by Appium</li> <li>The Selenium client library - owned by Selenium</li> <li>The network (local or Internet)</li> <li>The Appium server - owned by Appium</li> <li>The Appium XCUITest driver - owned by Appium</li> <li>WebDriverAgent - owned by Appium</li> <li>Xcode - owned by Apple</li> <li>XCUITest - owned by Apple</li> <li>iOS itself - owned by Apple</li> <li>macOS (where Xcode and iOS simulators run) - owned by Apple</li> </ul> <p>It's a pretty deep stack!</p>"},{"location":"intro/drivers/#proxy-mode","title":"Proxy mode","text":"<p>There's one other important architectural aspect of drivers to understand. It can be exemplified again by the XCUITest driver. Recall that we just discussed how the two \"halves\" of the XCUITest driver both speak the WebDriver protocol---the Node.js half clicks right into Appium's WebDriver server, and the Objective-c half (WebDriverAgent) is its own WebDriver implementation.</p> <p>This opens up the possibility of Appium taking a shortcut in certain cases. Let's imagine that the XCUITest driver needs to implement the <code>Click Element</code> command. The internal code of this implementation would look something like taking the appropriate parameters and constructing an HTTP request to the WebDriverAgent server. In this case, we're basically just reconstructing the client's original call to the Appium server!<sup>4</sup> So there's really no need to even write a function implementing the <code>Click Element</code> command. Instead, the XCUITest driver can just let Appium know that this command should be proxied directly to some other WebDriver server.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with the concept of \"proxying,\" in this case it just means that the XCUITest driver will not be involved at all in handling the command. Instead it will merely be repackaged and forwarded to WebDriverAgent at the protocol level, and WebDriverAgent's response will likewise be passed back directly to the client, without any XCUITest driver code seeing it or modifying it.</p> <p>This architectural pattern provides a nice bonus for driver authors who choose to deal with the WebDriver protocol everywhere, rather than constructing bespoke protocols. It also means that Appium can create wrapper drivers for any other existing WebDriver implementation very easily. If you look at the Appium Safari driver code, for example, you'll see that it implements basically no standard commands, because all of these are proxied directly to an underlying SafariDriver process.</p> <p>It's important to understand that this proxying business is sometimes happening under the hood, because if you're ever diving into some open source driver code trying to figure out where a command is implemented, you might be surprised to find no implementation at all in the Node.js driver code itself! In that case, you'll need to figure out where commands are being proxied to so you can look there for the appropriate implementation.</p> <p>OK, that's enough for this very detailed introduction to drivers!</p> <ol> <li> <p>You might notice that <code>setUrl</code> doesn't look anything like <code>Navigate To</code>, so how did we know   to use it rather than some other random string? Well, Appium's WebDriver-protocol-to-method-name   mapping is defined in a special file within the <code>@appium/base-driver</code> package called   routes.js.   So if you're writing a driver, this is where you would go to figure out what method names to use   and what parameters to expect. Or you could look at the source for any of the main Appium   drivers!\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Of course, we want to keep the semantics as similar as possible, but in the world of iOS, for   example, launching an app via a deep link (a URL with a special app-specific scheme) is about as   close as we are going to get to navigating to a web URL.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>You could in theory, therefore, point your WebDriver client straight to WebDriverAgent and   bypass Appium entirely. This is usually not convenient, however, for a few reasons:\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>It's not exactly the same call, because the Appium server and the WebDriverAgent server   will generate different session IDs, but these differences will be handled transparently.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"intro/history/","title":"Appium Project History","text":"<p>Appium has been around in one form or another since 2012.

The length of the test passes on the iOS product was getting out of hand. Less testing was an option, but would come with additional risk, especially with it taking several days to get patches through the iOS App Store Review process. He thought back to his days working on websites and realized automation was the answer.</p> <p>Dan surveyed the existing landscape of tools, only to find that all of them hand major drawbacks. The tool supplied by Apple, UIAutomation, required tests to be written in JavaScript, and did not allow for real-time debugging or interpretation. It also had to be executed inside the Xcode profiling tool, Instruments. Other 3rd-party tools used private APIs and required SDKs and HTTP Servers to be embedded into the application. This seemed highly undesirable.</p> <p>Unsatisfied with the existing options, Dan asked his manager for some additional time to see if he could find a better way. He spent 2 weeks poking and prodding around to see if there was a way to use approved Apple technologies to automate an iOS application. The first implementation he tried used AppleScript to send messages to Mac UI elements using the OS X accessibility APIs. This worked to some degree, but would never work on real devices, not to mention other drawbacks.</p> <p>So he thought, what if I could get the UIAutomation framework to run in real time like an interpreter? He looked into it and he determined that all he would need to do is find a way to receive, execute, and reply to commands from within a UIAutomation javascript program. Using the utility Apple provided for executing shell commands he was able to <code>cat</code> sequentially ordered text files to receive commands, <code>eval()</code> the output to execute them, and write them back to disk with <code>python</code>.

The best-maintained library and the one the Appium team recommends using is WebdriverIO, so let's use that. Since we already have Appium installed we know our Node and NPM requirements are already satisfied. So just create a new project directory somewhere on your computer and then initialize a new Node.js project in it:</p> <pre><code>npm init\n</code></pre> <p>It doesn't really matter what you put in the prompts, just so long as you end up with a valid <code>package.json</code>.</p> <p>Now, install the <code>webdriverio</code> package via NPM:</p> <pre><code>npm i --save-dev webdriverio\n</code></pre> <p>Once this is done, your <code>package.json</code> file should include a section like the following:</p> package.json<pre><code>{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"webdriverio\": \"8.40.6\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now it's time to type up the test itself. Create a new file called <code>test.js</code> with the following contents:</p> test.js<pre><code>const {remote} = require('webdriverio');\n\nconst capabilities = {\n  platformName: 'Android',\n  'appium:automationName': 'UiAutomator2',\n  'appium:deviceName': 'Android',\n  'appium:appPackage': 'com.android.settings',\n  'appium:appActivity': '.Settings',\n};\n\nconst wdOpts = {\n  hostname: process.env.APPIUM_HOST || 'localhost',\n  port: parseInt(process.env.APPIUM_PORT, 10) || 4723,\n  logLevel: 'info',\n  capabilities,\n};\n\nasync function runTest() {\n  const driver = await remote(wdOpts);\n  try {\n    const batteryItem = await driver.$('//*[@text=\"Battery\"]');\n    await batteryItem.click();\n  } finally {\n    await driver.pause(1000);\n    await driver.deleteSession();\n  }\n}\n\nrunTest().catch(console.error);\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>It's not within the scope of this guide to give a complete run-down on the WebdriverIO client library or everything that's happening here, so we'll leave the code itself unexplained in detail for now.
