title: Command Line Interface

Appium provides a command-line executable (`appium`), which can be used to configure and launch
the Appium server, as well as manage Appium extensions (drivers and plugins).

The executable has four main subcommands: `server`, `driver`, `plugin`, and `setup`. All subcommands
(and sub-subcommands) can be run with the `--help`/`-h` option for usage instructions.
