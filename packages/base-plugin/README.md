# Appium Base Plugin

The base class used to create Appium plugins. This plugin should not be installed directly as it does nothing. Instead, you extend this plugin when creating your *own* Appium plugins. Check out the [Building Plugins](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/build-plugins/) to learn how to make use of this base class to develop Appium plugins.
