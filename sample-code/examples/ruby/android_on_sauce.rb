# This example automates a test of the Android example notepad app.
#
# To run this example, make sure you've run:
#   $ bundle install
#
# And set the environment variables:
#   SAUCE_USERNAME = your-sauce-username
#   SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY = your-sauce-key
#
# Then just:
#   $ rspec android_on_sauce.rb 
#
# Of note compared to the iOS example, here we're giving the package and
# activity, no OS and an empty browserName
#
# Of note compared to the non-sauce examples, you need to host your app
# somewhere Sauce Labs' cloud can fetch it for your test.
