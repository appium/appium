# GETTING STARTED
# -----------------
# This documentation is intended to show you how to get started with a
# simple Appium & appium_lib test.  This example is written without a specific
# testing framework in mind;  You can use appium_lib on any framework you like.
#
# INSTALLING RVM
# --------------
# We're assuming you've got rvm installed, but if not, from a terminal
# run the following line (removing the ""'s):
#
# "\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby"
#
# INSTALLING GEMS
# ---------------
# Then, change to the example directory:
#   "cd appium-location/sample-code/examples/ruby"
#
# and install the required gems with bundler by doing:
#   "bundle install"
#
# RUNNING THE TESTS
# -----------------
# To actually run the tests, make sure appium is running in another terminal
# window, then from the same window you used for the above commands, type
#   "ruby simple_test.rb"
#
# It will take a while, but once it's done you should get nothing but a line
# telling you "Tests Succeeded";  You'll see the iOS Simulator cranking away
# doing actions while we're running.
