This is the parent class that all Appium plugins inherit from. This plugin should not be installed
directly as it does nothing on its own. Instead, you should extend this plugin when creating your
*own* Appium plugins. Check out the [Building Plugins](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/developing/build-plugins/)
documentation for more details.
