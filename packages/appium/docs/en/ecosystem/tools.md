title: Appium-Related Tools
---

There are several Appium tools that have been created to to assist with things not directly related
to testing, such as Appium installation, test development, and more.

### Appium Inspector

Appium has a graphical client which can be used to inspect application screenshots, view the
application hierarchy, run Appium commands, record app interactions, and more. It is very useful
for Appium test development.

Find downloads and more information on its GitHub page: [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector)

### Appium Doctor

The `appium-doctor` CLI tool can be used to validate proper environment setup for Android and iOS
automation, and identify any common configuration issues. It can be installed with `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g @appium/doctor
```
