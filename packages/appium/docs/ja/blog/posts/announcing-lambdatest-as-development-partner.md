# Announcing LambdaTest as Appium's Newest Development Partner

As part of our ongoing effort to recognize organizations that meaningfully support the Appium project through dedicated maintainer time, we are excited to welcome our newest Development Partner: LambdaTest!
LambdaTest has long been an active participant in the automated testing ecosystem. Today, they are officially formalizing their commitment by investing people—dedicated engineers who will directly support Appium's development, maintenance, and ecosystem growth.
This kind of hands-on contribution is crucial for ensuring Appium continues to evolve. We deeply value partners who empower their engineering teams to contribute code directly to open source rather than just sponsorship.

LambdaTest engineers are already contributing actively across several key Appium repositories. Their current focus includes:
**appium-mcp** – Supporting Appium's implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to drive forward modern AI-assisted capabilities.
**appium-remote-xpc** – Contributing to the native macOS/XPC-based remote execution layer, essential for iOS automation.
**appium-tun-tap** – Assisting in the development and maintenance of network virtualization and tunneling components for advanced testing scenarios.

These contributions strengthen critical infrastructure within the Appium ecosystem and demonstrate LambdaTest's commitment to deep technical involvement in the project's evolution.
About LambdaTest

LambdaTest’s platform already serves a massive community of Appium users. As a GenAI-powered Quality Engineering Platform, they provide a full-stack testing cloud with 10,000+ real mobile devices and 3,000+ browsers.
Beyond standard infrastructure, they are pushing the boundaries of test execution with AI-native test management and next-generation agents like KaneAI. By supporting Appium alongside Selenium, Playwright, and other major frameworks, LambdaTest helps teams orchestrate intelligent automation at cloud scale.

LambdaTest will continue contributing people, code, and development expertise to strengthen Appium's core functionality. Their commitment represents a significant investment into the future of the framework, and we're thrilled to have them collaborating with us at this deeper level.
The Appium project is proud to recognize LambdaTest as our newest official Development Partner. We can't wait to see what we'll build together!
