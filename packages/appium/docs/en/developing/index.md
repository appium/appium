title: Developing Appium Extensions
---

The move to a modular structure in Appium 2 means that Appium extensions (drivers and plugins)
are now decoupled from the main Appium module, and you only need to install the extensions that you
want to use. Not only that, but this also unlocks the ability to develop entirely new extensions!

This section of the Appium documentation is intended to help aspiring developers with creating their
own Appium extension:

* For creating a driver, see the [Build Drivers](./build-drivers.md) page
* For creating a plugin, take a look at the [Build Plugins](build-plugins.md) page
* Drivers and plugins both need documentation, so check out the [Build Documentation](./build-docs.md) page
