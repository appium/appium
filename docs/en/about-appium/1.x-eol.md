# Appium version 1 End Of Life (EOL) Plan

Appium 1 has been around for quite a while and now is the time to move
project development forward and to provide even better automation
experience with Appium version 2.

## Upgrading to Appium 2.x

While Appium 2.0 leaves most of the fundamental automation behaviors from the various platfrom
drivers untouched, it does rework the way that drivers are installed and accessed, and enforces
stricter protocol usage, among other changes. For that reason, it's important to fully read,
understand, and implement the steps discussed in the [Appium 1.x to 2.x Migration
Guide](../advanced-concepts/migrating-to-appium-2.0.md). There you will find a full list of the
changes, their rationale, and what you will need to do to keep your tests running well.

## Transition Plan

As of May 2020, Appium 2.0 has been in beta release and ready for your use and testing. Please
begin the process of ensuring your test suites, or any other software built on Appium, is
compatible with Appium 2.0.

The tentative release date of Appium 2.0 is *September 15, 2021*. After the release of
Appium 2.0 (whether it is on that date or not), we will not be making any feature additions to the
Appium 1.x server. We will however make the following kinds of updates for 6 months following the
release of Appium 2.0 (until March 15, 2022):

* Feature updates and bug fixes to core drivers (XCUITest, UiAutomator2, Espresso). For the first
  6 months of Appium 2.x's life, the core drivers will be supported on both Appium 1.x and 2.x.
* Bug fixes to the Appium 1.x server.

Once the 6 months of transition have passed, we will publish new versions of the core drivers that
will only be compatible with Appium 2.x. From that point forward, no features, platform support, or
patches will be added to 1.x.

Based on the current release schedule, it is likely that Appium 1.22.x will be the last in the set
of Appium 1.x releases.

## Documentation

Since Appium 2.0's documentation may not be published on the website until its release, you may
want to check out the `docs` folders in this repo, under the `2.0` git branch.
