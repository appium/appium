# Announcing Sauce Labs as Appium's Strategic Partner

The good news surrounding our new [sponsorship and contributor compensation
program](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/blog/2024/05/14/announcing-appiums-sponsorship-program/)
just keeps coming! Effective immediately we are fortunate and excited to be able to welcome a new Strategic Partner to
the Appium project: <a href="https://saucelabs.com/resources/blog/appium-strategic-partner">Sauce Labs</a>!

Sauce Labs has a long history of support for the Appium project. In fact, Appium was initially
incubated at Sauce Labs under the direction of [@jlipps](https://github.com/jlipps), in the early
days of mobile automation. Sauce Labs always envisioned Appium as being a project for and by the
community, and cemented this perspective in 2016 with the donation of Appium to the JS Foundation
(now the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/)). To this day, developers associated with Sauce
Labs continue to help maintain various parts of the Appium project.

Now, Sauce Labs is making a further commitment to support Appium financially as a way to enable
our new contributor compensation program. We're very excited about this program as a vehicle for
getting more people involved in Appium's development and maintenance. With the help of Strategic
Partners like Sauce Labs, our project will be better able to meet the needs of our constantly
growing userbase, and attract new developers (like you?) to build the Appium ecosystem together.
Needless to say, we are extremely grateful for Sauce Labs's support!
