title: Intro to Commands
---

Here you can find various commands exposed by the main Appium module through its base driver, as
well as the commands available in several plugins.

!!! note

```
The Appium base driver only exposes a few commands, as it is not meant to be used on its own.
Please refer to the documentation of your [Appium driver](../ecosystem/drivers.md) to learn
about the commands it exposes, and then check your [Appium client](../ecosystem/clients.md)
documentation for the exact syntax of that command.
```

The command listings can be found here:

- [Base Driver](./base-driver.md)
- [Execute Driver Plugin](./execute-driver-plugin.md)
- [Images Plugin](./images-plugin.md)
- [Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/tree/main/plugins)
- [Relaxed Caps Plugin](./relaxed-caps-plugin.md)
- [Storage Plugin](./storage-plugin.md)
- [Universal XML Plugin](./universal-xml-plugin.md)
